| [hledger-api](#hledger-api-1.10)
| [credits](#credits-1.10)

### project-wide changes for 1.10

* build cleanly with all supported GHC versions again (7.10 to 8.4)

* support latest deps

* back in Stackage LTS (12.0)


### hledger-lib 1.10

* extensive refactoring and cleanup of parsers and related types and utilities

* readJournalFile(s) cleanup, these now use InputOpts

* doctests now run a bit faster (#802)


### hledger 1.10

* journal: many parse error messages have become more informative, and
  some now show the source line and error location.

* journal: `;tag:` is no longer parsed as a tag named ";tag" (#655)

* journal: transaction price amounts having their own price amounts is
  now a parse error

* journal: amounts with space as digit group separator and trailing whitespace 
  now parse correctly (#780)

* journal: in amounts containing digits and a single space, the space
  is now interpreted as a digit group separator, not a decimal separator (#749)

* journal: in commodity/format/D directives, the amount must now include a decimal separator.

  When more precise control is needed over number parsing, our
  recommended solution is commodity directives. Commodity directives
  that don't specify the decimal separator leave things ambiguous,
  increasing the chance of misparsing numbers. In some cases it could
  cause amounts with a decimal point to be parsed as if with a digit
  group separator, so 1.234 became 1234.

  It seems the simple and really only way to do this reliably is to require
  an explicit decimal point character. Most folks probably do this already.
  Unfortunately, it makes another potential incompatiblity with ledger and
  beancount journals. But the error message will be clear and easy to
  work around.

* journal: directives currently have diverse and somewhat tricky
  semantics, especially with multiple files.  The manual now describes
  their behaviour precisely.

* journal: `alias` and `apply account` directives now affect `account` directives (#825)

* journal: periodic transactions can now have all the usual transaction fields
  (status mark, code, description, comment), for generating more expressive
  forecast transactions.

* journal: forecast transactions now have the generating period
  expression attached as a tag named "recur".

* journal: periodic transactions now start on the first instance of the 
  recurring date, rather than the day after the last regular transaction (#750)

* journal: periodic transaction rules now allow period expressions relative to today's date

* csv: amount-in/amount-out errors are more detailed

* balance: --drop is now ignored when not in flat mode, 
  rather than producing a corrupted report (#754)

* budget: --drop now preserves the <unbudgeted> top-level account in --budget reports

* register: in CSV output, the code field is now included (#746)

* smart dates now allow  the YYYYMM format, and are better documented

* uses hledger-lib 1.10


### hledger-ui 1.10

* the effect of --value, --forecast, and --anon flags is now preserved on reload (#753)

* edit-at-transaction-position is now also supported when $EDITOR is neovim

* support/require fsnotify 0.3.0.1+

* uses hledger-lib 1.10


### hledger-web 1.10

* view, add, edit permissions can be set at CLI or by Sandstorm HTTP header

* the edit form has been revived, for whole-journal editing

* the journal can now be uploaded and downloaded

* the e key toggles empty accounts in the sidebar

* multiple -f options, and --auto, work again

* uses hledger-lib 1.10


### hledger-api 1.10

* uses hledger-lib 1.10

### project-wide changes for 1.9

* support ghc 8.4, latest deps


### hledger-lib 1.9

* when the system text encoding is UTF-8, ignore any UTF-8 BOM prefix
found when reading files.

* CompoundBalanceReport amounts are now normally positive. (experimental)

### hledger 1.9

* journal: account directives can define a numeric account code to
customize sorting.  bal/bs/cf/is will sort accounts by account code,
if any, then account name.

* journal: support scientific number notation (#704, #706)

* csv: reading a CSV file containing no records is no longer an error

* cli: when the system text encoding is UTF-8, ignore any UTF-8 BOM
prefix found when reading files.  (Paypal's new CSV has this BOM
prefix, causing a confusing parse error.)

* cli: tabular reports no longer have a trailing blank line added.
(This allows omitting the ">=0" delimiters in our functional tests,
making them easier to read and maintain.)

* acc: the accounts command now has --declared and --used flags

* bal: the --invert flag flips all signs

* bal: --drop now works with CSV output

* bal/bs/bse/cf/is: show overall report span in title

* bal/bs/bse/cf/is: show short month names as headings in monthly reports

* bal/bs/bse/cf/is: these commands can now generate HTML output

* bal/bs/is/cf: drop short name and indent fields from multicolumn CSV

* bs/bse/cf/is: these, the "financial statement" commands, now show
normal income, liability and equity balances as positive numbers.
Negative numbers now indicate a contra-balance (eg an overdrawn
checking account), a net loss, or a negative net worth.  This makes
these reports more like conventional financial statements, and easier
to read and share with others. (Other commands, like balance, have not
changed.)  (experimental)

* bs/cf/is: always show a tabular report, even with no report
interval.  Previously you would get a simple borderless report like
the original balance command.  Less code, fewer bugs.

* bs/bse/cf/is: in CSV output, don't repeat the headings row for each subreport

* budget: warn that CSV output with bal --budget is unimplemented

* budget: bal --budget shows budget goals even with no or zero actual amounts. 
Makes budget reports more intuitive, at the cost of a temporary hack
which may misorder columns in some cases (if actual and budget
activity occur in a different range of columns).

* budget: --budget uses only periodic txns with the selected interval.  
Budgets with different interval, eg a daily and weekly budget, are independent.

* budget: show mostly fixed-width columns for readability

* budget: fix bug where a budget report could include budget goals
ending on the day before the report start date (splitSpan issue)

* close: the equity command has been renamed to close.  It now ignores
any begin date (it always closes historical end balances).  It also
ignores --date2.

### hledger-ui 1.9

* -E/--empty toggles zeroes at startup (with opposite default to cli)

### hledger-web 1.9

* -E/--empty toggles zeroes at startup (with opposite default to cli)

### hledger-api 1.9

| [hledger-ui](#hledger-ui-1.5)
| [hledger-web](#hledger-web-1.5)
| [hledger-api](#hledger-api-1.5)

### project-wide changes for 1.5

* remove upper bounds on all but hledger* and base (experimental)
  It's rare that my deps break their api or that newer versions must
  be avoided, and very common that they release new versions which I
  must tediously and promptly test and release hackage revisions for
  or risk falling out of stackage. Trying it this way for a bit.


### hledger-lib 1.5

* -V/--value uses today's market prices by default, not those of last transaction date. #683, #648)

* csv: allow balance assignment (balance assertion only, no amount) in csv records (Nadrieril)

* journal: allow space as digit group separator character, #330 (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: balance assertion errors now show line of failed assertion posting, #481 (Sam Jeeves)

* journal: better errors for directives, #402 (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: better errors for included files, #660 (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: commodity directives in parent files are inherited by included files, #487 (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: commodity directives limits precision even after -B, #509 (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: decimal point/digit group separator chars are now inferred from an applicable commodity directive or default commodity directive. #399, #487 (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: numbers are parsed more strictly (Mykola Orliuk)

* journal: support Ledger-style automated postings, enabled with --auto flag (Dmitry Astapov)

* journal: support Ledger-style periodic transactions, enabled with --forecast flag (Dmitry Astapov)

* period expressions: fix "nth day of {week,month}", which could generate wrong intervals (Dmitry Astapov)

* period expressions: month names are now case-insensitive (Dmitry Astapov)

* period expressions: stricter checking for invalid expressions (Mykola Orliuk)

* period expressions: support "every 11th Nov" (Dmitry Astapov)

* period expressions: support "every 2nd Thursday of month" (Dmitry Astapov)

* period expressions: support "every Tuesday", short for "every <n>th day of week" (Dmitry Astapov)

### hledger 1.5

* --auto adds Ledger-style automated postings to transactions (Dmitry Astapov, Mykola Orliuk)

* --forecast generates Ledger-style periodic transactions in the future (Dmitry Astapov, Mykola Orliuk)

* -V/--value uses today's market prices by default, not those of last transaction date. #683, #648

* add: suggest implied (parent) and declared (by account directives) account names also

* bal: --budget shows performance compared to budget goals defined
  with periodic transactions.  Accounts with budget goals are
  displayed folded (depth-clipped) at a depth matching the budget
  specification.  Unbudgeted accounts are hidden, or with
  --show-unbudgeted, shown at their usual depth. (Dmitry Astapov)

* import: the output of --dry-run is now valid journal format

* print: -B shows converted amounts again, as in 1.1, even without
  -x. #551 (Mykola Orliuk, Simon Michael)

* tag: the first argument now filters tag names, additional arguments
  filter transactions (#261)

### hledger-ui 1.5

* fix help -> view manual (on posix platforms) #623

* support -V/--value, --forecast, --auto

### hledger-web 1.5

* add form account fields now suggest implied and declared account names also

* add form date field now uses a datepicker (Eli Flanagan)

* don't write a session file at startup, don't require a writable working directory

* support -V/--value, --forecast, --auto

### hledger-api 1.5


## 2017/9/30 hledger 1.4

***easy install script,
simpler help commands,
experimental addon commands now built in,
new balancesheetequity/tags commands,
new import command for easy CSV merging,

| [hledger-ui](#hledger-ui-1.4)
| [hledger-web](#hledger-web-1.4)
| [hledger-api](#hledger-api-1.4)

### project-wide changes for 1.4

* update stack configs for the last three GHC versions, add "make
test-stackage" for finding stackage build problems, switch to GHC
8.2.1 as default for developer builds

* streamline docs page

* improve changelog/release notes process

* improve makefile help and speed

* Added a new installer script for the hledger tools, which aims to
dodge common pitfalls and just work. Based on the stack install
script, this bash script is cross platform, uses cabal or stack,
installs stack and GHC if needed, and installs the latest release of
all major hledger packages. See http://hledger.org/download for details.

### hledger-lib 1.4

* add readJournalFile[s]WithOpts, with simpler arguments and support
for detecting new transactions since the last read.

* query: add payee: and note: query terms, improve description/payee/note docs (Jakub Zárybnický, Simon Michael, #598, #608)

* journal, cli: make trailing whitespace significant in regex account aliases
Trailing whitespace in the replacement part of a regular expression
account alias is now significant. Eg, converting a parent account to
just an account name prefix: --alias '/:acct:/=:acct '

* timedot: allow a quantity of seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months
  or years to be logged as Ns, Nm, Nd, Nw, Nmo, Ny

* csv: switch the order of generated postings, so account1 is first.
This simplifies things and facilitates future improvements.

* csv: show the "creating/using rules file" message only with --debug

* csv: fix multiple includes in one rules file

* csv: add "newest-first" rule for more robust same-day ordering

* deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7

* deps: add missing parsec lower bound, possibly related to #596, fpco/stackage#2835

* deps: drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+

* deps: remove ghc < 7.6 support, remove obsolete CPP conditionals

* deps: fix test suite with ghc 8.2

<!-- 1.3.1 (2017/8/25) -->

* Fix a bug with -H showing nothing for empty periods (#583, Nicholas Niro)
This patch fixes a bug that happened when using the -H option on
a period without any transaction. Previously, the behavior was no
output at all even though it should have shown the previous ending balances
of past transactions. (This is similar to previously using -H with -E,
but with the extra advantage of not showing empty accounts)

* allow megaparsec 6 (#594)

* allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)

* fix test suite with Cabal 2 (#596)

### hledger 1.4

* cli: a @FILE argument reads flags & args from FILE, one per line

* cli: reorganized commands list, added some new command aliases:
  accounts: a
  balance:  b
  print:    p, txns
  register: r

* cli: accept -NUM as a shortcut for --depth=NUM (eg: -2)

* cli: improve command-line help for --date2 (#604)

* cli: make --help and -h the same, drop --man and --info for now (#579)

* help: offers multiple formats, accepts topic substrings.
  The separate info/man commands have been dropped. help now
  chooses an appropriate documentation format as follows: 
  - it uses info if available, 
  - otherwise man if available, 
  - otherwise $PAGER if defined, 
  - otherwise less if available, 
  - otherwise it prints on stdout
  - (and it always prints on stdout when piped). 
  You can override this with the `--info`/`--man`/`--pager`/`--cat` flags.
  (#579)

* bal/bs/cf/is: --sort-amount/-S sorts by largest amount instead of
  account name

* bs/cf/is: support --output-file and --output-format=txt|csv
  The CSV output should be reasonably ok for dragging into a
  spreadsheet and reformatting.

* bal/bs/cf/is: consistent double space between columns, consistent
  single final blank line.  Previously, amounts wider than the column
  headings would be separated by only a single space.

* bs/is: don't let an empty subreport disable the grand totals (fixes #588)

* cf: exclude asset accounts with ":fixed" in their name (Christian G. Warden, Simon Michael, #584)

* new balancesheetequity command: like balancesheet but also shows
  equity accounts (Nicholas Niro)

* new import command: adds new transactions seen in one or more input
  files to the main journal file

* print: --new shows only transactions added since last time
  (saves state in .latest.JOURNALFILE file)

* new tags command: lists tags in matched transactions

* most addons formerly shipped in bin/ are now builtin commands. These
  include: check-dates, check-dupes, equity, prices, print-unique,
  register-match, rewrite.

* refactor: new Commands module and subdirectory.
  Builtin commands are now gathered more tightly in a single module,
  Hledger.Cli.Commands, facilitating change.  The legacy "convert"
  command has been dropped.

* refactor: BalanceView -> CompoundBalanceCommand

* deps: drop support for directory < 1.2

* deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7

* deps: drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+

* deps: simplify shakespeare bounds

* deps: remove ghc < 7.6 support

<!-- 1.3.1 (2017/8/25) -->

* bs/is: don't let an empty subreport disable the grand totals (#588)

* allow megaparsec 6 (#594)

* allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)

* restore upper bounds on hledger packages

### hledger-ui 1.4

* a @FILE argument reads flags & args from FILE, one per line

* enable --pivot and --anon options, like hledger CLI (#474) (Jakub Zárybnický)

* accept -NUM as a shortcut for --depth NUM

* deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7

* deps: drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+

<!-- # 1.3.1 (2017/8/25) -->

* allow megaparsec 6 (#594, Simon Michael, Hans-Peter Deifel)

* allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)

* allow vty 5.17 (Felix Yan)

* allow brick 0.24

* restore upper bounds on hledger packages

### hledger-web 1.4

* a @FILE argument reads flags & args from FILE, one per line

* enable --pivot and --anon options, like hledger CLI (#474) (Jakub Zárybnický)

* web: Make "Add transaction" button tabbable (#430) (Jakub Zárybnický)

* accept -NUM as a shortcut for --depth NUM

* deps: drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+, remove ghc < 7.6 support

<!-- # 1.3.2 (2017/8/25) -->

* remove unnecessary bound to satisfy hackage server

<!-- # 1.3.1 (2017/8/25) -->

* allow megaparsec 6 (#594, Simon Michael, Hans-Peter Deifel)

* allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)

* restore upper bounds on hledger packages

### hledger-api 1.4

* api: add support for swagger2 2.1.5+ (fixes #612)

<!-- # 1.3.1 (2017/8/25) -->

* require servant-server 0.10+ to fix compilation warning

* restore upper bounds on hledger packages

### project-wide changes for 1.3

<!-- #### Packaging -->

<!-- #### Finance -->

<!-- #### Documentation and website -->

<!-- #### Examples -->

#### Tools

make ghci-prof starts GHCI in profiling mode, enabling stack traces with traceStack

make ghci-web now also creates required symlinks

make site-reload opens an auto-reloading browser on the latest site html

make changelog-draft shows the commits since last tag as org nodes

### hledger-lib 1.3

#### journal format

The "uncleared" transaction/posting status (and associated UI flags
and keys) has been renamed to "unmarked" to remove ambiguity and
confusion. See the issue and linked mail list discussion for more
background.  (#564)

#### csv format

In CSV conversion rules, assigning to the "balance" field name
creates balance assertions (#537, Dmitry Astapov).

Doubled minus signs are handled more robustly (fixes #524, Nicolas
Wavrant, Simon Michael)

#### Misc

Multiple status: query terms are now OR'd together. (#564)

Deps: allow megaparsec 5.3.

### hledger 1.3

#### CLI

The "uncleared" transaction/posting status, and associated UI flags
and keys, have been renamed to "unmarked" to remove ambiguity and
confusion.  This means that we have dropped the `--uncleared` flag,
and our `-U` flag now matches only unmarked things and not pending
ones. See the issue and linked mail list discussion for more
background. (#564)

Also the -P short flag has been added for --pending, and the -U/-P/-C
flags can be combined. 

bs/is: fix "Ratio has zero denominator" error (#535)

bs/is/cf: fix --flat (#552) (Justin Le, Simon Michael)

bal/bs/is/cf: show negative amounts in red (Simon Michael, Justin Le).
These commands now show negative amounts in red, when hledger detects
that ANSI codes are supported, (ie when TERM is not "dumb" and stdout
is not being redirected or piped).

print: show pending mark on postings (fixes #563).
A pending mark on postings is now displayed, just like a cleared mark.
Also there will now be a space between the mark and account name.

print: amounts are now better aligned, eg when there are posting
status marks or virtual postings.

#### Addons

prices: add --inverted-costs flag, sort output, increase precision
(Mykola Orliuk)

rewrite: add support for rewriting multipler postings into different
commodities. For example, postings in hours can be used to generate
postings in USD. (#557) (Christian G. Warden)

`make addons` compiles the experimental add-ons.

### hledger-ui 1.3

The register screen now shows transaction status marks.

The "uncleared" status, and associated UI flags and keys, have been
renamed to "unmarked" to remove ambiguity and confusion.  This means
that we have dropped the `--uncleared` flag, and our `-U` flag now
matches only unmarked things and not pending ones. See the issue and
linked mail list discussion for more background. (#564)

The P key toggles pending mode, consistent with U (unmarked) and C
(cleared). There is also a temporary --status-toggles flag for testing
other toggle styles; see `hledger-ui -h`. (#564)

There is now less "warping" of selection when lists change:

- When the selected account disappears, eg when toggling zero
  accounts, the selection moves to the alphabetically preceding item,
  instead of the first one.

- When the selected transaction disappears, eg when toggling status
  filters, the selection moves to the nearest transaction by date (and
  if several have the same date, by journal order), instead of the
  last one.

In the accounts and register screens, you can now scroll down further
so that the last item need not always be shown at the bottom of the
screen.  And we now try to show the selected item centered in the
following situations:

-   after moving to the end with Page down/End
-   after toggling filters/display modes (status, real, historical..)
-   on pressing the control-l key (this forces a screen redraw, also)
-   on entering the register screen from the accounts screen
    (except the first time, a known problem).

Items near the top won't be centered because we don't scroll above the
top of the list.

Emacs movement keys are now supported, as well as VI keys.
`CTRL-b/CTRL-f/CTRL-n/CTRL-p` and `hjkl` should work wherever unmodified arrow keys work.

In the transaction screen, amounts are now better aligned, eg when
there are posting status marks or virtual postings.

Deps: allow brick 0.19 (#575, Felix Yan, Simon Michael)

### project-wide changes for 1.2

#### Packaging

bump stack config to latest lts,
bump brick to 0.15.2 to allow hledger-iadd install in hledger dir,
update cabal files to latest hpack 0.17.0/stack 1.4 format (#512),
use more accurate license tag in Cabal file (Peter Simons).

#### Finance

set up a hledger open collective (http://opencollective.com/hledger),
more devguide links to issues with bounties,
codefund link,
start tracking and publishing project finances (dogfooding!).

#### Documentation and website

docs page & manual cleanups, 
begin organising a cookbook,
update addons list,
move detailed addon docs out of hledger manual,
document addons installation,
explain print's CSV output,
note an issue with balance assertions & multiple -f options,
clarify tags,
add github stars widget to home and devguide,
improve market price docs,
ui & web screenshots layout fixes,
fix extra whitespace after synopsis in hledger-web text manuals,
update accounts directive/budget/rewrite/read-related mockups,
drop old org notes.

#### Examples

consolidate extra/ and data/ in examples/,
tarsnap csv rules & reporting example,
xpensetracker csv rules.

#### Tools

Travis CI now checks functional tests/build warnings/addons,
temporary workaround for Appveyor CI failures,
remove accidentally committed pandoc executables,
some pandoc filter fixes,
mailmap file to clean up git log authors,
bench.hs cleanup,
fix gitignore of generated manuals,
avoid excessive rebuilding with make [func]test,
run functional tests more verbosely,
add alex/happy update step to cabal-install.sh.

### hledger-lib 1.2

#### journal format

A pipe character can optionally be used to delimit payee names in
transaction descriptions, for more accurate querying and pivoting by
payee.  Eg, for a description like `payee name | additional notes`,
the two parts will be accessible as pseudo-fields/tags named `payee`
and `note`.
<!-- (When descriptions do not contain a pipe character, `payee` and `note` are synonyms for `description`.) -->

Some journal parse errors now show the range of lines involved, not just the first.

#### ledger format

The experimental `ledger:` reader based on the WIP ledger4 project has
been disabled, reducing build dependencies.

#### Misc

Fix a bug when tying the knot between postings and their parent transaction, reducing memory usage by about 10% (#483) (Mykola Orliuk)

Fix a few spaceleaks (#413) (Moritz Kiefer)

Add Ledger.Parse.Text to package.yaml, fixing a potential build failure.

Allow megaparsec 5.2 (#503)

Rename optserror -> usageError, consolidate with other error functions

### hledger 1.2

#### CLI

"hledger" and "hledger -h" now print a better organised commands list
and general usage message respectively (#297).

The common reporting flags can now be used anywhere on the command line.

Fixed deduplication of addons in commands list.

Fixed ugly stack traces in command line parse error messages.

The -V/--value flag is now a global report flag, so it works with
balance, print, register, balancesheet, incomestatement, cashflow,
etc. (Justin Le)

The `--pivot` global reporting option replaces all account names with
the value of some other field or tag. It has been improved, eg:

- we don't add the field/tag name name as a prefix
- when pivoting on a tag, if the tag is missing we show a blank 
  (rather than showing mixed tag values and account names)
- a pipe character delimiter may be used in descriptions to get a more accurate
  and useful payee report (`hledger balance --pivot payee`)

options cleanups

#### Addons

Easier installation:
move add-ons and example scripts to bin/, 
convert to stack scripts,
add a build script to install all deps,
add some functional tests,
test add-ons with Travis CI,
add installation docs to download page.

Improved docs: 
all addons now contain their own documentation. Most of them (all but
hledger-budget) use a new reduced-boilerplate declaration format
and can show short (-h) and long (--help) command line help.
(Long help is declared with pre and postambles to the generated
options help, short help is that truncated at the start of the hledger
common flags.)

`hledger` now shows a cleaner list of addon commands, showing only the
compiled version of an addon when both source and compiled versions
are in $PATH. (Addons with .exe extension or no extension are
considered compiled.  Modification time is not checked, ie, an old
compiled addon will override a newer source version.  If there are
three or more versions of an addon, all are shown.  )

New addons added/included:

- autosync - example symlink to ledger-autosync
- budget - experimental budget reporting command supporting Ledger-like periodic transactions and automated transactions (Mykola Orliuk)
- chart - pie-chart-generating prototype, a repackaging of the old hledger-chart tool
- check - more powerful balance assertions (Michael Walker)
- check-dupes - find accounts sharing the same leaf name (Stefano Rodighiero)
- prices - show all market price records (Mykola Orliuk)
- register-match - a helper for ledger-autosync's deduplication, finds best match for a transaction description

The equity command now always generates a valid journal transaction,
handles prices better, and adds balance assertions (Mykola Orliuk).

The rewrite command is more robust and powerful (Mykola Orliuk):

- in addition to command-line rewrite options, it understands rewrite rules
  defined in the journal, similar to Ledger's automated transactions (#99).
  Eg:
    ```journal
    = ^income
        (liabilities:tax)  *.33

    = expenses:gifts
        budget:gifts  *-1
        assets:budget  *1
    ```

- it can generate diff output, allowing easier review of the proposed
  changes, and safe modification of original journal files (preserving
  file-level comments and directives). Eg:
    ```
    hledger-rewrite --diff Agency --add-posting 'Expenses:Taxes  *0.17' | patch
    ```

- rewrites can affect multiple postings in a transaction, not just one.

- posting-specific dates are handled better

#### balance

A new --pretty-tables option uses unicode characters for rendering
table borders in multicolumn reports (#522) (Moritz Kiefer)

#### balancesheet/cashflow/incomestatement

These commands are now more powerful, able to show multicolumn reports
and generally having the same features as the balance command. (Justin Le)

balancesheet has always ignored a begin date specified with a `-b` or
`-p` option; now it also ignores a begin date specified with a `date:`
query. (Related discussion at #531)

#### print

The output of print is now always a valid journal (fixes #465) (Mykola Orliuk).

print now tries to preserves the format of implicit/explicit balancing
amounts and prices, by default. To print with all amounts explicit,
use the new `--explicit/-x` flag (fixes #442). (Mykola Orliuk)
    
Don't lose the commodity of zero amounts/zero balance assertions (fixes #475) (Mykola Orliuk)

#### Misc

Fix a regression in the readability of option parsing errors (#478) (Hans-Peter Deifel)

Fix an example in Cli/Main.hs (Steven R. Baker)

Allow megaparsec 5.2 (#503)

### hledger-ui 1.2

Fix a pattern match failure when pressing E on the transaction screen (fixes #508)

Accounts with ? in name had empty registers (fixes #498) (Bryan Richter)

Allow brick 0.16 (Joshua Chia) and brick 0.17/vty 0.15 (Peter Simons)

Allow megaparsec 5.2 (fixes #503)

Allow text-zipper 0.10

### hledger-web 1.2

Accounts with ? in name had empty registers (fixes #498) (Bryan Richter)

Allow megaparsec 5.2 (fixes #503)

<!-- ### hledger-api 1.2 -->

| [hledger-ui](#hledger-ui-1.1)
| [hledger-web](#hledger-web-1.1)
| [hledger-api](#hledger-api-1.1)

### project-wide changes for 1.1

#### misc

-   don't show stack trace details in errors

-   more predictable [file format detection](/hledger.html#input-files)
    
    When we don't recognise a file's extension, instead of choosing a subset of
    readers to try based on content sniffing, now we just try them all.
    Also, this can be overridden by prepending the reader name and a
    colon to the file path (eg timedot:file.dat, csv:-).

-   avoid creating junk CSV rules files when trying alternate readers.
    We now create it only after successfully reading a file as CSV.

-   improvements to [-B](/journal.html#transaction-prices) and [-V](/hledger.html#market-value) docs: clearer descriptions, more linkage ([#403](http://bugs.hledger.org/403))

### hledger-lib 1.1

#### journal format

-   [balance assignments](/journal.html#balance-assignments) are now supported ([#438](http://bugs.hledger.org/438), [#129](http://bugs.hledger.org/129), [#157](http://bugs.hledger.org/157), [#288](http://bugs.hledger.org/288))

    This feature also brings a slight performance drop (~5%);
    optimisations welcome.

-   also recognise `*.hledger` files as hledger journal format

#### ledger format

-   use ledger-parse from the ledger4 project as an alternate reader for C++ Ledger journals
    
    The idea is that some day we might get better compatibility with Ledger files this way.
    Right now this reader is not very useful and will be used only if you explicitly select it with a `ledger:` prefix.
    It parses transaction dates, descriptions, accounts and amounts, and ignores everything else.
    Amount parsing is delegated to hledger's journal parser, and malformed amounts might be silently ignored.

    This adds at least some of the following as new dependencies for hledger-lib:
    parsers, parsec, attoparsec, trifecta.

#### misc

-   update base lower bound to enforce GHC 7.10+
    
    hledger-lib had a valid install plan with GHC 7.8, but currently requires GHC 7.10 to compile.
    Now we require base 4.8+ everywhere to ensure the right GHC version at the start.
    
-   Hledger.Read api cleanups

-   rename dbgIO to dbg0IO, consistent with dbg0, and document a bug in dbg*IO

-   make readJournalFiles [f] equivalent to readJournalFile f ([#437](http://bugs.hledger.org/437))

-   more general parser types enabling reuse outside of IO ([#439](http://bugs.hledger.org/439))

### hledger 1.1

#### balance

-   with -V, don't ignore market prices in the future ([#453](http://bugs.hledger.org/453), [#403](http://bugs.hledger.org/403))

-   with -V and multiple same-date market prices, use the last parsed not the highest price ([#403](http://bugs.hledger.org/403))

#### misc

-   fix non-existent "oldtime" dependency ([#431](http://bugs.hledger.org/431))

-   [hledger-equity.hs](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/bin/hledger-equity.hs) now generates valid journal format when there are multiple commodities

### hledger-ui 1.1

-   with [--watch](/hledger-ui.html#options), the display updates automatically to show file or date changes

    hledger-ui --watch will reload data when the journal file (or any included file) changes.
    Also, when viewing a current standard period (ie this day/week/month/quarter/year),
    the period will move as needed to track the current system date.

-   the [--change](/hledger-ui.html#options) flag shows period changes at startup instead of historical ending balances

-   the A key runs the hledger-iadd tool, if installed

-   always reload when g is pressed

    Previously it would check the modification time and reload only if
    it looked newer than the last reload.

-   mark hledger-ui as "stable"

-   allow brick 0.15, vty 5.14, text-zipper 0.9

### hledger-web 1.1

-   add [--host](/hledger-web.html#options) option ([#429](http://bugs.hledger.org/429))
    
    This came up in the context of Docker, but it seems it wasn't
    possible for hledger-web to serve remote clients directly (without
    a proxy) because of 127.0.0.1 being hardcoded. That can now be
    changed with --host=IPADDR. Also, the default base url uses this
    address rather than a hard-coded "localhost".
    
-   rename --server to --serve

    The --server flag sounded too close in meaning to --host so
    I've renamed it to --serve. The old spelling is still accepted,
    but deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### hledger-api 1.1

-   serves on 127.0.0.1 by default, [--host](/hledger-api.html#options) option added ([#432](http://bugs.hledger.org/432))
    
    Consistent with hledger-web: serves only local requests by default,
    use --host=IPADDR to change this.

-   fixed the version string in command-line help and swagger info



## 2016/10/26 hledger 1.0

***More hledger-ui features, 
better hledger-web layout,
new hledger-api server, 
new timedot format,

### project-wide changes for 1.0

#### misc

-   added GHC 8 support, dropped GHC 7.6 and 7.8 support.

    GHC 7.8 support could be restored with small code changes and a maintainer.

-   a cabal.project file has been added (Moritz Kiefer)

-   use hpack for maintaining cabal files ([#371](http://bugs.hledger.org/371)).

    Instead of editing cabal files directly, we now edit the less
    verbose and less redundant package.yaml files and let stack (or
    hpack) update the cabal files. We commit both the .yaml and
    .cabal files.

-   clean up some old cabal flags

-   tools/simplebench has been spun off as the [quickbench](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickbench) package.

-   add Appveyor CI builds, provide more up-to-date Windows binaries

-   extra: add a bunch of CSV rules examples

#### docs

-   the website is simpler, clearer, and more mobile-friendly.

    Docs are now collected on a single page and organised by type: getting started, reference, more.

-   reference docs have been split into one manual for each executable and file format.

    This helps with maintenance and packaging and also should make it
    easier to see what's available and to read just what you need.

-   manuals are now provided in html, plain text, man and info formats

    generated from the same source by a new Shake-based docs build system. ([#292](http://bugs.hledger.org/292))

-   versioned manuals are provided on the website, covering recent releases and the latest dev version ([#385](http://bugs.hledger.org/385), [#387](http://bugs.hledger.org/387))

-   manuals are built in to the hledger executables, allowing easy offline reading on all platforms.

        PROG -h              shows PROG's command-line usage
        PROG --help          shows PROG's manual (fixed width)
        PROG --man           shows PROG's manual with man (formatted/paged)
        PROG --info          shows PROG's manual with info (hypertext)
        hledger help [TOPIC] shows any manual
        hledger man  [TOPIC] shows any manual with man
        hledger info [TOPIC] shows any manual with info

-   the general and reporting options are now listed in all executable manuals.

    We assume any of them which are unsupported are harmlessly ignored.

-   demo.hledger.org is using beancount's example journal.

    This is the somewhat realistic example journal from the beancount
    project, tweaked for hledger.

-   minor copyedits (jungle-boogie)

#### cli

-   parsing multiple input files is now robust.

    When multiple -f options are provided, we now parse each file
    individually rather than just concatenating them, so they can
    have different formats ([#320](http://bugs.hledger.org/320)).  Note this also means that
    directives (like \`Y\` or \`alias\`) no longer carry over from one
    file to the next.

-   I has been added as the short flag for --ignore-assertions

    (this is different from Ledger's CLI, but useful for hledger-ui).

-   parsing an argument-less --debug option is more robust

### hledger-lib 1.0

#### timedot format

-   new "timedot" format for retroactive/approximate time logging.

    Timedot is a plain text format for logging dated, categorised
    quantities (eg time), supported by hledger.  It is convenient
    for approximate and retroactive time logging, eg when the
    real-time clock-in/out required with a timeclock file is too
    precise or too interruptive.  It can be formatted like a bar
    chart, making clear at a glance where time was spent.

#### timeclock format

-   renamed "timelog" format to "timeclock", matching the emacs package

-   sessions can no longer span file boundaries (unclocked-out

    sessions will be auto-closed at the end of the file).

-   transaction ids now count up rather than down ([#394](http://bugs.hledger.org/394))

-   timeclock files no longer support default year directives

-   removed old code for appending timeclock transactions to journal transactions.

    A holdover from the days when both were allowed in one file.

#### csv format

-   fix empty field assignment parsing, rule parse errors after megaparsec port ([#407](http://bugs.hledger.org/407)) (Hans-Peter Deifel)

#### journal format

-   journal files can now include timeclock or timedot files ([#320](http://bugs.hledger.org/320))

    (but not yet CSV files).

-   fixed an issue with ordering of same-date transactions included from other files

-   the "commodity" directive and "format" subdirective are now supported, allowing

    full control of commodity style ([#295](http://bugs.hledger.org/295)) The commodity directive's
    format subdirective can now be used to override the inferred
    style for a commodity, eg to increase or decrease the
    precision. This is at least a good workaround for [#295](http://bugs.hledger.org/295).

-   Ledger-style "apply account"/"end apply account" directives are now used to set a default parent account.

-   the Ledger-style "account" directive is now accepted (and ignored).

-   bracketed posting dates are more robust ([#304](http://bugs.hledger.org/304))

    Bracketed posting dates were fragile; they worked only if you
    wrote full 10-character dates. Also some semantics were a bit
    unclear. Now they should be robust, and have been documented
    more clearly. This is a legacy undocumented Ledger syntax, but
    it improves compatibility and might be preferable to the more
    verbose "date:" tags if you write posting dates often (as I do).
    Internally, bracketed posting dates are no longer considered to
    be tags.  Journal comment, tag, and posting date parsers have
    been reworked, all with doctests.

-   balance assertion failure messages are clearer

-   with --debug=2, more detail about balance assertions is shown.

#### misc

-   file parsers have been ported from Parsec to Megaparsec \o/ ([#289](http://bugs.hledger.org/289), [#366](http://bugs.hledger.org/366)) (Alexey Shmalko, Moritz Kiefer)

-   most hledger types have been converted from String to Text, reducing memory usage by 30%+ on large files

-   file parsers have been simplified for easier troubleshooting ([#275](http://bugs.hledger.org/275)).

    The journal/timeclock/timedot parsers, instead of constructing
    opaque journal update functions which are later applied to build
    the journal, now construct the journal directly by modifying the
    parser state. This is easier to understand and debug. It also
    rules out the possibility of journal updates being a space
    leak. (They weren't, in fact this change increased memory usage
    slightly, but that has been addressed in other ways).  The
    ParsedJournal type alias has been added to distinguish
    "being-parsed" journals and "finalised" journals.

-   file format detection is more robust.

    The Journal, Timelog and Timedot readers' detectors now check
    each line in the sample data, not just the first one. I think the
    sample data is only about 30 chars right now, but even so this
    fixed a format detection issue I was seeing. 
    Also, we now always try parsing stdin as journal format (not just sometimes).

-   all file formats now produce transaction ids, not just journal ([#394](http://bugs.hledger.org/394))

-   git clone of the hledger repo on windows now works ([#345](http://bugs.hledger.org/345))

-   added missing benchmark file ([#342](http://bugs.hledger.org/342))

-   our stack.yaml files are more compatible across stack versions ([#300](http://bugs.hledger.org/300))

-   use [newer file-embed](https://github.com/snoyberg/file-embed/issues/18) to fix ghci working directory dependence

-   report more accurate dates in account transaction report when postings have their own dates

    (affects hledger-ui and hledger-web registers).
    The newly-named "transaction register date" is the date to be
    displayed for that transaction in a transaction register, for
    some current account and filter query.  It is either the
    transaction date from the journal ("transaction general date"),
    or if postings to the current account and matched by the
    register's filter query have their own dates, the earliest of
    those posting dates.

-   simplify account transactions report's running total.

    The account transactions report used for hledger-ui and -web
    registers now gives either the "period total" or "historical
    total", depending strictly on the --historical flag. It doesn't
    try to indicate whether the historical total is the accurate
    historical balance (which depends on the user's report query).

-   reloading a file now preserves the effect of options, query arguments etc.

-   reloading a journal should now reload all included files as well.

-   the Hledger.Read.\* modules have been reorganised for better reuse.

    Hledger.Read.Utils has been renamed Hledger.Read.Common
    and holds low-level parsers & utilities; high-level read
    utilities are now in Hledger.Read.

-   clarify amount display style canonicalisation code and terminology a bit.

    Individual amounts still have styles; from these we derive
    the standard "commodity styles". In user docs, we might call
    these "commodity formats" since they can be controlled by the
    "format" subdirective in journal files.

-   Journal is now a monoid

-   expandPath now throws a proper IO error

-   more unit tests, start using doctest

### hledger 1.0

#### add

-   suggest only one commodity at a time as default amount ([#383](http://bugs.hledger.org/383))

    (since we currently can't input more than one at a time)

#### balance

-   added --change flag for consistency

-   H/--historical now also affects single-column balance reports with a start date ([#392](http://bugs.hledger.org/392)).

    This has the same effect as just omitting the start date, but adds consistency.

-   in CSV output, render amounts in one-line format ([#336](http://bugs.hledger.org/336))

#### balancesheet

-   fix an infinite loop ([#393](http://bugs.hledger.org/393))

#### print

-   in CSV output, fix and rename the transaction id field

#### register

-   fix a sorting regression with --date2 ([#326](http://bugs.hledger.org/326))

-   --average/-A is now affected by --historical/-H

-   added --cumulative flag for consistency

-   in CSV output, include the transaction id and rename the total field ([#391](http://bugs.hledger.org/391))

#### stats

-   fixed an issue with ordering of include files

#### misc

-   --pivot option added, groups postings by tag instead of account ([#323](http://bugs.hledger.org/323)) (Malte Brandy)

-   --anon option added, obfuscates account names and descriptions ([#265](http://bugs.hledger.org/265)) (Brian Scott)

    (Only affects the hledger tool, for now.)

-   try to clarify balance/register's various report modes,

    kinds of "balance" displayed, and related options and language.

-   with multiple --change/--cumulative/--historical flags, use the last one instead of complaining

-   don't add the "d" suffix when displaying day periods

-   stack-ify extra/hledger-rewrite.hs

### hledger-ui 1.0

#### accounts screen

-   at depth 0, show accounts on one "All" line and show all transactions in the register

-   0 now sets depth limit to 0 instead of clearing it

-   always use --no-elide for a more regular accounts tree

#### register screen

-   registers can now include/exclude subaccount transactions.

    The register screen now includes subaccounts' transactions if the
    accounts screen was in tree mode, or when showing an account
    which was at the depth limit. Ie, it always shows the
    transactions contributing to the balance displayed on the
    accounts screen. As on the accounts screen, F toggles between
    tree mode/subaccount txns included by default and flat
    mode/subaccount txns excluded by default. (At least, it does when
    it would make a difference.)

-   register transactions are filtered by realness and status ([#354](http://bugs.hledger.org/354)).

    Two fixes for the account transactions report when --real/--cleared/real:/status: 
    are in effect, affecting hledger-ui and hledger-web:
    
    1.  exclude transactions which affect the current account via an excluded posting type.
        Eg when --real is in effect, a transaction posting to the current account with only
        virtual postings will not appear in the report.
    
    2.  when showing historical balances, don't count excluded posting types in the
        starting balance. Eg with --real, the starting balance will be the sum of only the
        non-virtual prior postings.
        
        This is complicated and there might be some ways to confuse it still, causing
        wrongly included/excluded transactions or wrong historical balances/running totals
        (transactions with both real and virtual postings to the current account, perhaps ?)

-   show more accurate dates when postings have their own dates.

    If postings to the register account matched by the register's
    filter query have their own dates, we show the earliest of these
    as the transaction date.

#### misc

-   H toggles between showing "historical" or "period" balances ([#392](http://bugs.hledger.org/392)).

    By default hledger-ui now shows historical balances, which
    include transactions before the report start date (like hledger
    balance --historical). Use the H key to toggle to "period" mode,
    where balances start from 0 on the report start date.

-   shift arrow keys allow quick period browsing

    -   shift-down narrows to the next smaller standard period
        (year/quarter/month/week/day), shift-up does the reverse
    -   when narrowed to a standard period, shift-right/left moves to
        the next/previous period
    -   \`t\` sets the period to today.

-   a runs the add command

-   E runs $HLEDGER<sub>UI</sub><sub>EDITOR</sub> or $EDITOR or a default editor (vi) on the journal file.

    When using emacs or vi, if a transaction is selected the cursor will be positioned at its journal entry.

-   / key sets the filter query; BACKSPACE/DELETE clears it

-   Z toggles display of zero items (like --empty), and they are shown by default.

    -E/--empty is now the default for hledger-ui, so accounts with 0 balance
    and transactions posting 0 change are shown by default.  The Z key
    toggles this, entering "nonzero" mode which hides zero items.

-   R toggles inclusion of only real (non-virtual) postings

-   U toggles inclusion of only uncleared transactions/postings

-   I toggles balance assertions checking, useful for troubleshooting

-   vi-style movement keys are now supported (for help, you must now use ? not h) ([#357](http://bugs.hledger.org/357))

-   ESC cancels minibuffer/help or clears the filter query and jumps to top screen

-   ENTER has been reserved for later use

-   reloading now preserves any options and modes in effect

-   reloading on the error screen now updates the message rather than entering a new error screen

-   the help dialog is more detailed, includes the hledger-ui manual, and uses the full terminal width if needed

-   the header/footer content is more efficient; historical/period and tree/flat modes are now indicated in the footer

-   date: query args on the command line now affect the report period.

    A date2: arg or --date2 flag might also affect it (untested).

-   hledger-ui now uses the quicker-building microlens

### hledger-web 1.0

#### ui

-   use full width on large screens, hide sidebar on small screens, more standard bootstrap styling ([#418](http://bugs.hledger.org/418), [#422](http://bugs.hledger.org/422)) (Dominik Süß)

-   show the sidebar by default ([#310](http://bugs.hledger.org/310))

-   fix the add link's tooltip

-   when the add form opens, focus the first field ([#338](http://bugs.hledger.org/338))

-   leave the add form's date field blank, avoiding a problem with tab clearing it ([#322](http://bugs.hledger.org/322))

-   use transaction id instead of date in transaction urls ([#308](http://bugs.hledger.org/308)) (Thomas R. Koll)

-   after following a link to a transaction, highlight it (Thomas R. Koll)

-   misc. HTML/CSS/file cleanups/fixes (Thomas R. Koll)

#### misc

-   startup is more robust ([#226](http://bugs.hledger.org/226)).

    Now we exit if something is already using the specified port,
    and we don't open a browser page before the app is ready.

-   termination is more robust, avoiding stray background threads.

    We terminate the server thread more carefully on exit, eg on control-C in GHCI.

-   more robust register dates and filtering in some situations (see hledger-ui notes)

-   reloading the journal preserves options, arguments in effect ([#314](http://bugs.hledger.org/314)).

    The initial query specified by command line arguments is now preserved
    when the journal is reloaded. This does not appear in the web UI, it's
    like an invisible extra filter.

-   show a proper not found page on 404

-   document the special \`inacct:\` query ([#390](http://bugs.hledger.org/390))

### hledger-api 1.0

#### misc

-   new hledger-api tool: a simple web API server with example clients ([#316](http://bugs.hledger.org/316))

-   start an Angular-based API example client ([#316](http://bugs.hledger.org/316)) (Thomas R. Koll)



## 2015/10/30 hledger 0.27

***New curses-style interface, market value reporting, wide characters, fast regex aliases, man pages***
([announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.hledger/1267))
<!-- [announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hledger/3w7G0H9e7aE) -->

Release contributors:
Simon Michael,
Carlos Lopez-Camey.

**hledger 0.27:**

Account aliases:

- Regular expression account aliases are now fast enough that you can
  use lots of them without slowing things down. They now take
  O(aliases x accounts) time, instead of O(aliases x transactions);
  also, regular expressions are no longer recompiled unnecessarily.

Documentation:

- The hledger packages now have man pages, based on the current user
  manual, thanks to the mighty pandoc ([#282](http://bugs.hledger.org/282)).
 
Journal format:

- Dates must now begin with a digit (not /, eg).

- The comment directive longer requires an end comment, and will
  extend to the end of the file(s) without it.

Command-line interface:

- Output (balance reports, register reports, print output etc.)
  containing wide characters, eg chinese/japanese/korean characters,
  should now align correctly, when viewed in apps and fonts that show
  wide characters as double width ([#242](http://bugs.hledger.org/242)).
 
- The argument for --depth or depth: must now be positive.

add:

- Journal entries are now saved with all amounts explicit, to avoid
  losing price info ([#283](http://bugs.hledger.org/283)).

- Fixed a bug which sometimes (when the same letter pair was repeated)
  caused it not to pick the most similar past transaction for defaults.
    
balance:

- There is now a -V/--value flag to report current market value (as in Ledger).
  It converts all reported amounts using their "default market price".
  "Market price" is the new name for "historical prices", defined with the P directive.
  The default market price for a commodity is the most recent one found in the journal on or before the report end date.
    
    Unlike Ledger, hledger's -V uses only the market prices recorded
  with P directives; it does not use the transaction prices
  recorded as part of posting amounts.
  Using both -B and -V at the same time is possible.

- Fixed a bug in amount normalization which caused amount styles
  (commodity symbol placement, decimal point character, etc.) to be
  lost in certain cases ([#230](http://bugs.hledger.org/230), [#276](http://bugs.hledger.org/276)).

- The balance command's --format option can now adjust the rendering
  style of multi-commodity amounts, if you begin the format string
  with one of:
    
     %_  - renders amounts on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)
     %^  - renders amounts on multiple lines, top-aligned
     %,  - renders amounts on one line, comma-separated
    
- The balance report's final total (and the line above it) now adapt
  themselves to a custom --format.

print:

- The --match option prints the journal entry that best matches a
  description (ie whose description field is most similar to the value
  given, and if there are several equally similar, the most recent).
  This was originally an add-on I used to guess account names for
  ledger-autosync. It's nice for quickly looking up a recent
  transaction from a guessed or partial description.

- print now always right-aligns the amounts in an entry, even when
  they are wider than 12 characters.  (If there is a price, it's
  considered part of the amount for right-alignment.)

register:

- Amount columns now resize automatically, using more space if it's
  needed and available.

**hledger-ui 0.27:**

- [hledger-ui](manual#ui) is a new curses-style UI, intended to be a standard part
  of the hledger toolset for all users (except on native MS Windows,
  where the vty lib is not [yet](https://github.com/coreyoconnor/vty/pull/1) supported).

    The UI is quite simple, allowing just browsing of accounts and
  transactions, but it has a number of improvements over the old
  hledger-vty, which it replaces:

    - adapts to screen size
    - handles wide characters
    - shows multi-commodity amounts on one line
    - manages cursor and scroll position better
    - allows depth adjustment
    - allows --flat toggle
    - allows --cleared toggle
    - allows journal reloading
    - shows a more useful transaction register, like hledger-web
    - offers multiple color themes
    - includes some built-in help

    hledger-ui is built with brick, a new higher-level UI library based
  on vty, making it relatively easy to grow and maintain.

**hledger-web 0.27:**

- Fix keyboard shortcut for adding a transaction (Carlos Lopez-Camey)

- Clear the form when clicking 'Add a transaction' (just like the shortcut) (Carlos Lopez-Camey)

- Disallow -f- (reading from standard input) which currently doesn't work ([#202](http://bugs.hledger.org/202))

- Fix broken links when using --base-url ([#235](http://bugs.hledger.org/235))

- Fix the --file-url option ([#285](http://bugs.hledger.org/285))

- Show fewer "other accounts" in the account register: to reduce
  clutter in the "other accounts" field, if there are both real and
  virtual postings to other accounts, show only the accounts posted to
  by real postings.

***Website & doc updates, account aliases, misc. bugfixes & cleanups, performance.***

Release contributors:
Simon Michael,
Imuli,
Carlos Lopez-Camey,
Kyle Marek-Spartz,
Rick Lupton,
Simon Hengel.

**Changes to hledger.org & docs:**

- examples everywhere, screenshots, content & style updates
- manual: reorganise topics, add some undocumented things, clarify some things
- dev guide: more links, put how-tos first, copy diagram from old wiki, update the setup docs


**User-visible changes in hledger since 0.25.1:**

Account aliases:

- Account aliases are once again non-regular-expression-based, by default. (#252)
    
    The regex account aliases added in 0.24 tend to trip up people
    switching between hledger and Ledger. (Also they are currently
    slow).  We now use the old non-regular-expression aliases again,
    by default; these are unsurprising, useful, and pretty close in
    functionality to Ledger's aliases.

    The new regex aliases are still available, but they must now be
    enclosed in forward slashes. (Ledger effectively ignores these.)
    
Journal format:

- We now parse, and also print, journal entries with no postings, as
  proposed on the mail lists.  These are not well-formed General
  Journal entries/transactions, but on the other hand:
    Ledger and beancount parse them;
    if they are parsed, they should be printed;
    they provide a convenient way to record (and report) non-transaction events;
    and they permit more gradual introduction and learning of the concepts
    (so eg a beginner can keep a simple journal before learning about accounts and postings).

- Trailing whitespace after a `comment` directive is now ignored.

Command-line interface:

- The -f/file option may now be used multiple times. 
  This is equivalent to concatenating the input files before running hledger.
  The add command adds entries to the first file specified.

Queries:

- real: (no argument) is now a synonym for real:1

- tag: now matches tag names with a regular expression, like most other queries

- empty: is no longer supported, as it overlaps a bit confusingly with
  amt:0. The --empty flag is still available.

- You can now match on pending status (#250)
    
    A transaction/posting status of ! (pending) was effectively equivalent
    to * (cleared). Now it's a separate state, not matched by --cleared.
    The new Ledger-compatible --pending flag matches it, and so does
    --uncleared.

    The relevant search query terms are now status:*, status:! and
    status: (the old status:1 and status:0 spellings are deprecated).
    
    Since we interpret --uncleared and status: as "any state except cleared",
    it's not currently possible to match things which are neither cleared
    nor pending.

activity:

- activity no longer excludes 0-amount postings by default.

add:

- Don't show quotes around the journal file path in the "Creating..."
  message, for consistency with the subsequent "Adding..." message.

balancesheet:

- Accounts beginning with "debt" or now also recognised as liabilities.

print:

- We now limit the display precision of inferred prices. (#262)
    
    When a transaction posts to two commodities without specifying the
    conversion price, we generate a price which makes it balance (cf
    http://hledger.org/manual.html#prices). The print command showed
    this with full precision (so that manual calculations with the
    displayed numbers would look right), but this sometimes meant we
    showed 255 digits (when there are multiple postings in the
    commodity being priced, and the averaged unit price is an
    irrational number). In this case we now set the price's display
    precision to the sum of the (max) display precisions of the
    commodities involved. An example:
    ```
    hledger -f- print
    <<<
    1/1
        c    C 10.00
        c    C 11.00
        d  D -320.00
    >>>
    2015/01/01
        c  C 10.00 @ D 15.2381
        c  C 11.00 @ D 15.2381
        d     D -320.00
    
    >>>=0
    ```
    There might still be cases where this will show more price decimal
    places than necessary. 

- We now show inferred unit prices with at least 2 decimal places.
    
    When inferring prices, if the commodities involved have low
    display precisions, we don't do a good job of rendering
    accurate-looking unit prices. Eg if the journal doesn't use any
    decimal places, any inferred unit prices are also displayed with
    no decimal places, which makes them look wrong to the user.  Now,
    we always give inferred unit prices a minimum display precision of
    2, which helps a bit.

register:

- Postings with no amounts could give a runtime error in some obscure case, now fixed.

stats: 

- stats now supports -o/--outputfile, like register/balance/print.
- An O(n^2) performance slowdown has been fixed, it's now much faster on large journals.
    ```

    ```
    
Miscellaneous:

- The June 30 day span was not being rendered correctly; fixed. (#272)
- The deprecated shakespeare-text dependency has been removed more thoroughly.
- The bench script invoked by "cabal bench" or "stack bench" now runs
  some simple benchmarks.
  You can get more accurate benchmark times by running with --criterion.
  This will usually give much the same numbers and takes much longer.
  Or with --simplebench, it benchmarks whatever commands are
  configured in bench/default.bench. This mode uses the first
  "hledger" executable in $PATH.

***GHC 7.10 compatibility, terminal width awareness, useful averages and totals columns, and a more robust hledger-web add form.***

Release contributors:
Simon Michael,
Julien Moutinho.

**User-visible changes in hledger since 0.24.1:**

- GHC 7.10 compatibility ([#239](http://bugs.hledger.org/239))

- On POSIX systems, the register command now uses the full terminal width by
    default. Specifically, the output width is set from:
    
    1. a --width option
    2. or a COLUMNS environment variable (NB: not the same as a bash shell var)
    3. or on POSIX (non-windows) systems, the current terminal width
    4. or the default, 80 characters.
    
    This feature requires the C curses dev libraries, making installation slightly harder.
    If that's a problem you can disable curses support with a cabal flag:
    `cabal install -f-curses ...`.

- register's --width option now accepts an optional
    description column width following the overall width (`--width
    WIDTH[,DESCWIDTH]`). This also sets the account column width, since
    the available space (WIDTH-41) is divided up between these two
    columns. Here's a diagram:
<br clear="all">
```    
    <--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
    date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
    DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA
```    
    Examples:
```
    $ hledger reg                 # use terminal width on posix
    $ hledger reg -w 100          # width 100, equal description/account widths
    $ hledger reg -w 100,40       # width 100, wider description
    $ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,100 # terminal width and set description width
```

- balance: new -T/--row-total and -A/--average options

    In multicolumn balance reports, -T/--row-total now shows a totals
    column and -A/--average shows an averages column.
    This helps eg to see monthly average expenses (hledger bal ^expenses -MA).

    NB our use of -T deviates from Ledger's UI, where -T sets a custom
    final total expression.

- balance: -N is now short for --no-total
- balance: fix partially-visible totals row with --no-total
    
    A periodic (not using --cumulative or --historical) balance report
    with --no-total now hides the totals row properly.

- journal, csv: comment lines can also start with *
    
    As in Ledger. This means you can embed emacs org/outline-mode nodes in
    your journal file and manipulate it like an outline.

**User-visible changes in hledger-web since 0.24.1:**

- GHC 7.10 compatibility ([#239](http://bugs.hledger.org/239))

- fix the add form when there are included files ([#234](http://bugs.hledger.org/234))

    NB to make this work, the add form now shows the full file path of
    the main and included journal files.

- improve add form validation ([#223](http://bugs.hledger.org/223), [#234](http://bugs.hledger.org/234))
    
    All add form errors are displayed as form errors, not internal
    server errors, and when there are errors the add form is redisplayed
    (form inputs are not preserved, currently).

- keep the add button right-aligned when pressing ctrl - on the add form

#### 2015/3/15 hledger 0.24.1

- timelog: show hours with 2 decimal places, not 1 ([#237](http://bugs.hledger.org/237))
- fix balance accumulation through assertions in several commodities ([#195](http://bugs.hledger.org/195))
- fix rendering of week 52 heading in weekly reports
- allow utf8-string-1 ([fpco/stackage/#426](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/issues/426))

#### 2015/3/15 hledger-lib 0.24.1

- fix JournalReader "ctx" compilation warning
- add some type signatures in Utils to help make ghci-web

#### 2015/1/10 hledger-web 0.24.1

- add missing modules to fix cabal tests ([#232](http://bugs.hledger.org/232))

+--------------------------------------------++----------------+--------------+--------+
```

Journal format:

- detect decimal point and digit groups more robustly ([#196](http://bugs.hledger.org/196))
- check that transaction dates are followed by whitespace or newline
- check that dates use a consistent separator character
- balance assertions now are specific to a single commodity, like
  Ledger ([#195](http://bugs.hledger.org/195))
- support multi-line comments using "comment", "end comment"
  directives, like Ledger

CSV format:

- fix: reading CSV data from stdin now works better
- the original order of same-day transactions is now usually preserved
  (if the records appear to be in reverse date order, we reverse them
  before finally sorting by transaction date)
- the rules file include directive is now relative to the current
  file's directory ([#198](http://bugs.hledger.org/198))
- CSV output is now built in to the balance, print, and register
  commands, controlled by -O/--output-format (and -o/--output-file,
  see below). This means that hledger data can be easily exported,
  eg for spreadsheet reporting or to migrate to a different tool.

CLI:

- the --width and --debug options now require their argument ([#149](http://bugs.hledger.org/149))
- when an option is repeated, the last value takes precedence ([#219](http://bugs.hledger.org/219)).
  This is helpful eg for customising your reporting command aliases on
  the fly.
- smart dates (used in -p/-b/-e/date:/date2:) now must use a
  consistent separator character, and must be parseable to the end
- output destination and format selection is now built in to the
  balance, print and register commands, controlled by -o/--output-file
  and -O/--output-format options. Notes:
  -o - means stdout.
  An output file name suffix matching a supported format will also
  set the output format, unless overridden by --output-format.
  Commands' supported output formats are listed in their
  command-line help. Two formats are currently available:
  txt (the default) and csv.
- balance assertions can be disabled with --ignore-assertions

Account aliases:

- all matching account aliases are now applied, not just one directive
  and one option
- account aliases now match by case insensitive regular expressions
  matching anywhere in the account name
- account aliases can replace multiple occurrences of the pattern
  within an account name
- an account alias replacement pattern can reference matched groups
  with \\N

Queries:

- date:/date2: with a malformed date now reports an error instead of
  being ignored
- amt: now supports >= or <=
- clarify status: docs and behaviour; "*" is no longer a synonym for
  "1" (fixes [#227](http://bugs.hledger.org/227))

balance:

- fix: in tree mode, --drop is ignored instead of showing empty account names
- a depth limit of 0 now shows summary items with account name "...",
  instead of an empty report ([#206](http://bugs.hledger.org/206))
- in multicolumn balance reports, -E now also shows posting-less
  accounts with a non-zero balance during the period (in addition to
  showing leading & trailing empty columns)
- in multicolumn reports, multi-commodity amounts are rendered on one
  line for better layout ([#186](http://bugs.hledger.org/186))
- multicolumn reports' title now includes the report span

register:

- runs faster with large output
- supports date2:, and date:/date2: combined with --date2, better (fixes
  [#201](http://bugs.hledger.org/201), [#221](http://bugs.hledger.org/221), [#222](http://bugs.hledger.org/222))
- a depth limit of 0 now shows summary items (see balance)
- -A/--average now implies -E/--empty
- postings with multi-commodity amounts are now top-aligned, like
  Ledger


**User-visible changes in hledger-web since 0.23.3:**

General:

- fix: add missing hs/js files to package
- the web UI has been streamlined, dropping the raw and entries views and
  the edit form
- the help dialog has been improved
- keyboard shortcuts are now available
- the sidebar can be toggled open or closed (press s)

Journal view:

- layout tweaks for less truncation of descriptions and account names

Register view:

- fix: don't show all zero amounts when searching by account within an
  account register view
- chart improvements: show zero balances with correct commodity; show
  accurate balance at all dates; show transaction events & tooltips;
  show zero/today lines & background colors

Add form:

- parses data more strictly and gives better errors (eg [#194](http://bugs.hledger.org/194))
- allows any number of postings, not just two
- after adding a transaction, goes back to the journal
- keyboard shortcut (a) allows quick access

Dependencies:

- allow warp 3\*, wai-handler-launch 3\*
- require yesod 1.4* (fixes [#212](http://bugs.hledger.org/212))
- js updated (jquery, bootstrap, flot), added (typeahead, cookie, hotkeys),
  removed (select2)


**API-ish changes in hledger-lib since 0.23.3:**

- fix combineJournalUpdates folding order
- fix a regexReplaceCI bug
- fix a splitAtElement bug with adjacent separators
- mostly replace slow regexpr with regex-tdfa (fixes [#189](http://bugs.hledger.org/189))
- use the modern Text.Parsec API
- allow transformers 0.4*
- regexReplace now supports backreferences
- Transactions now remember their parse location in the journal file
- export Regexp types, disambiguate CsvReader's similarly-named type
- export failIfInvalidMonth/Day (closes [#216](http://bugs.hledger.org/216))
- track the commodity of zero amounts when possible
  (useful eg for hledger-web's multi-commodity charts)
- show posting dates in debug output
- more debug helpers


#### 2014/9/12 hledger-web 0.23.3

- remove warp, wai-handler-launch upper bounds (fixes [#205](http://bugs.hledger.org/205))

#### 2014/9/12 hledger 0.23.3

- allow text 1.2+ (fixes [#207](http://bugs.hledger.org/207))

#### 2014/5/8 hledger 0.23.2

- register: also fix date sorting of postings ([#184](http://bugs.hledger.org/184))

#### 2014/5/7 hledger 0.23.1

- register: fix a refactoring-related regression that the tests
  missed: if transactions were not ordered by date in the journal,
  register could include postings before the report start date in the
  output. ([#184](http://bugs.hledger.org/184))
- add: don't apply a default commodity to amounts on entry ([#138](http://bugs.hledger.org/138))
- cli: options before the add-on command name are now also passed to it ([#182](http://bugs.hledger.org/182))
- csv: allow the first name in a fields list to be empty ([#178](http://bugs.hledger.org/178))
- csv: don't validate fields count in skipped lines ([#177](http://bugs.hledger.org/177))


## 2014/5/1 hledger 0.23

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.hledger/1028)
***command-line fixes and polish, a new accounts
command, and a number of changes to the balance command relating
to --depth, --flat, and multicolumn mode, which I find has made it much
more useful.***

Changes since 0.22.2:

Journal format:

- A # (hash) in column 0 is now also supported for starting a top-level journal comment, like Ledger.
- The "too many missing amounts" error now reminds about the 2-space rule.
- Fix: . (period) is no longer parsed as a valid amount.
- Fix: default commodity directives no longer limit the maximum display precision ([#169](http://bugs.hledger.org/169)).
- Fix: + before an amount is no longer parsed as part of the commodity ([#181](http://bugs.hledger.org/181)).

CLI:

- Command-line help cleanups, layout improvements.
- Descriptions are shown for known add-ons in the command list.
- Command aliases have been simplified.
- Add-ons can now have any of these file extensions:
  none, hs, lhs, pl, py, rb, rkt, sh, bat, com, exe.
- Add-ons are displayed without their file extensions when possible.
- Add-ons with the same name as a built-in command or alias are ignored.
- Fix: add-on detection and invocation now works on windows.
- Fix: add-ons with digits in the name are now found.
- Fix: add-on arguments containing a single quote now work.
- Fix: when -- is used to hide add-on options from the main program,
  it is no longer passed through as an add-on argument.

accounts:

- An accounts command has been added, similar to Ledger's, for listing account names
  in flat or hierarchical mode.

add:

- Tab completion now works at all prompts, and will insert the default if the input area is empty.
- Account and amount defaults are more robust and useful.
- Transactions may also be completed by the enter key, when there are no more default postings.
- Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when supported.

balance:

- Balance reports in flat mode now always show exclusive (subaccount-excluding) balances.
- Balance reports in flat mode with --depth now aggregate deeper accounts at the depth limit instead of excluding them.
- Multicolumn reports in flat mode now support --drop.
- Multicolumn balance reports can now show the account hierarchy with --tree.
- Multicolumn report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed
  report periods, so the first and last periods are "full" and comparable to the others.
- Fix: zero-balance leaf accounts below a non-zero-balance parent are no longer always shown ([#170](http://bugs.hledger.org/170)).
- Fix: multicolumn reports now support --date2 (cf [#174](http://bugs.hledger.org/174)).

balancesheet, cashflow, incomestatement:

- These commands now support --flat and --drop.

print:

- Tag queries (tag:) will now match a transaction if any of its postings match.

register:

- The --display option has been dropped. To see an accurate running total which
  includes the prior starting balance, use --historical/-H (like balance). 
- With a report interval, report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed
  periods, so the first and last periods are "full" and comparable to the others.
- Fix: --date2 now works with report intervals (fixes [#174](http://bugs.hledger.org/174)).

Queries:

- The currency/commodity query prefix (sym:) has been renamed to cur:.
- Currency/commodity queries are applied more strongly in register and
  balance reports, filtering out unwanted currencies entirely. Eg
  hledger balance cur:'\$' now reports only the dollar amounts even if
  there are multi-currency transactions or postings.
- Amount queries like amt:N, amt:<N and amt:>N, where N is not 0, now do an unsigned
  comparison of the amount and N. That is, they compare the absolute magnitude.
  To do a signed comparison instead, write N with its sign (eg amt:+N, amt:<+N, amt:>-N).
- Fix: amount queries no longer give false positives on multi-commodity amounts.

Miscellaneous:

- Default report dates now derive from the secondary dates when --date2 is in effect.
- Default report dates now notice any posting dates outside the transaction dates' span.
- Debug output improvements.
- New add-on example: extra/hledger-rewrite.hs, adds postings to matched entries.
- Compatible with GHC 7.2 ([#155](http://bugs.hledger.org/155)) - GHC 7.8, shakespeare 2


## 2014/5/1 hledger-web 0.23

Changes since 0.22.8:

- The --static-root flag has been renamed to --file-url.
- hledger-web now builds with Cabal's default -O, not -O2,
  so may be a little quicker/less memory-hungry to install.


#### 2014/4/29 hledger-web 0.22.8

- allow shakespeare 2.* ([#179](http://bugs.hledger.org/179))

#### 2014/4/17 hledger-web 0.22.7

- add Peter Simons' patch fixing Data.Conduit.Network HostIPv4 error ([#171](http://bugs.hledger.org/171))

#### 2014/4/16 hledger-web 0.22.6

- depend on hledger[-lib] 0.22.2

#### 2014/4/16 hledger 0.22.2

- display years before 1000 with four digits, not three
- avoid pretty-show to build with GHC < 7.4
- allow text 1.1, drop data-pprint to build with GHC 7.8.x

#### 2014/4/15 hledger-web 0.22.5

- allow http-client 0.3.*, fixing cabal install again with GHC <= 7.6 (not yet 7.8)
- use pretty-show only with GHC 7.4+, fixing GHC 7.2 (fixes [#155](http://bugs.hledger.org/155))
- allow warp 2.1, fixing cabal install

#### 2014/2/10 hledger-web 0.22.4

* web: include the right unminified version of jquery.url.js (1.1) to avoid js breakage

#### 2014/2/10 hledger-web 0.22.3

* web: fix version number reported by --version

#### 2014/2/10 hledger-web 0.22.2

New:

* web: new option `--static-root` to set the base url for static files

Improved:

* web: include unminified source of all javascript to help packagers (fixes [#161](http://bugs.hledger.org/161))
* web: work around clang-related build failures with OS X mavericks/XCode 5
* web: allow blaze-html 0.7 (closes [#159](http://bugs.hledger.org/159))


#### 2014/1/6 hledger 0.22.1

- require the latest pretty-show so hledger installation no longer
  needs an upgraded version of happy, and the docs build on hackage

- require regex-tdfa directly instead of regex-compat-tdfa,
  simplifying Debian packaging

## 2013/12/13 hledger 0.22

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.general/5333)

New:

- balance: with a reporting interval (monthly, yearly etc.), the
  [balance command](manual.html#balance) will now show a multi-column report, showing either
  the per-period changes in balance (by default),
  the period ending balances starting from zero (`--cumulative`),
  or the actual period ending balances (`--historical`).
  A more detailed specification of the balance command's behaviour
  has been added to [Hledger.Cli.Balance](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger/docs/Hledger-Cli-Balance.html).

- csv: rules files can now include other rules files, useful for factoring out common rules

- queries: `sym:REGEXP` matches commodity symbols

- register: `--average/-A` shows a running average, like ledger

- in period expressions, `-` (hyphen) can be used as a more compact
  synonym for `from` and `to`.  Eg: `-p 2012/12/1-2013/2/1` or `date:aug-`.

- the add-on script examples in extra/ have been updated; get the
  hledger source and add .../hledger/extra/ to your PATH to make them
  available.  They include:

  - `hledger-accountnames.hs` - print account names
  - `hledger-balance-csv.hs`  - print a balance report as CSV
  - `hledger-equity.hs`       - print an entry matching all account balances (like ledger)
  - `hledger-print-unique.hs` - print only journal entries unique descriptions
  - `hledger-register-csv.hs` - print a register report as CSV

Improved:

- balancesheet: now shows just assets and liabilities, not equity

- print: comment positions (same line or next line) are now preserved

- queries: `amt` now uses the = operator by default, eg `amt:50` is
  equivalent to `amt:=50`

- command line processing has been overhauled and made more
  consistent, and now has tests and debug output.  More flags now work
  both before and after COMMAND: `-f`, `--rule-file`, `--alias`,
  `--help`, `--debug`, `--version`.  Command line help, command
  aliases, API docs and code have been improved.

- `--debug` now takes an optional numeric argument to set the debug level
  higher than 1, for more verbose debug output in a few cases.

Fixed:

- csv: CSV data containing non-ascii characters is now supported

- build with latest versions of dependencies (text, warp, http-conduit etc.)

Release contributors:

Marko Kocić, Max Bolingbroke, and a big welcome to first-time committer John Wiegley! :)

#### 2013/7/10 hledger-web 0.21.3

  - drop yesod-platform dependency, it is not worthwhile. The other
    yesod dependencies are currently without version ranges, so cabal
    install might require --constraint to restrict them in some cases.

#### 2013/6/23 hledger 0.21.3

  - csv: fix wrong application of multiple assignments in a conditional block

#### 2013/6/4 hledger 0.21.2

  - web: fix a build failure

#### 2013/6/3 hledger 0.21.1

  - web: show proper Y-values in register chart (fixes [#122](http://bugs.hledger.org/122))
  - web: avoid trailing commas in register chart values, in case of trouble with IE

## 2013/6/1 hledger 0.21

Bugs fixed:

  - parsing: don't fail when a csv amount has trailing whitespace (fixes [#113](http://bugs.hledger.org/113))
  - web: don't show prices in the accounts sidebar (fixes [#114](http://bugs.hledger.org/114))
  - web: show one line per commodity in charts. Needs more polish, but fixes [#109](http://bugs.hledger.org/109).
  - web: bump yesod-platform dependency to avoid a cabal install failure

Journal reading:

  - balance assertions are now checked after reading a journal

web command:

  - web: support/require yesod 1.2
  - web: show zero-balance accounts in the sidebar (fixes [#106](http://bugs.hledger.org/106))
  - web: use nicer select2 autocomplete widgets in the add form

Documentation and infrastructure:

  - add basic cabal test suites for hledger-lib and hledger

#### 2013/5/4 hledger 0.20.0.1

  * web: require at least version 1.1.7 of yesod-core to avoid a potential build error
  * Update the bug tracker and source repository links on hackage

## 2013/5/1 hledger 0.20

Bugs fixed:

  * balance: a 0.19 regression which showed wrong total balance with `--flat` has been fixed ([#94](http://bugs.hledger.org/94))
  * register: when `--date2` is used, the register is now sorted by the secondary date
  * web: some missing static & template files have been added to the package, fixing cabal-dev and hackage builds ([#97](http://bugs.hledger.org/97), [#98](http://bugs.hledger.org/98))
  * web: some hardcoded static urls have been fixed
  * Dependencies and code have been updated to support the latest
    libraries and GHC versions.  For now, hledger requires GHC 7.2+
    and hledger-web requires GHC 7.4+.

Journal reading:

  - DOS-style line-endings are now also supported in journal and rules files.
  - `!` is now accepted in the status field as well as `*`, like ledger
  - The *actual date* and *effective date* terminology has changed to *primary date* and *secondary date*.
    Use `--date2` to select the secondary date for reports. (`--aux-date` or `--effective` are also accepted
    for ledger and backwards compatibility).
  - Per-posting dates are supported, using hledger tags or ledger's posting date syntax
  - Comment and tag handling has been improved

CSV reading:

  - CSV conversion rules have a simpler, more flexible [syntax](manual.html#csv).
    Existing rules files will need to be updated manually:
    - the filename is now `FILE.csv.rules` instead of `FILE.rules`
    - `FIELD-field N` is now `FIELD %N+1` (or set them all at once with a `fields` rule)
    - `base-currency` is now `currency`
    - `base-account` is now `account1`
    - account-assigning rules:
      add `if` before the list of regexps,
      add indented `account2 ` before the account name
  - parenthesised amounts are parsed as negative

Querying:

  - Use `code:` to match the transaction code (check number) field
  - Use `amt:` followed by `<`, `=` or `>` and a number N to match
    amounts by magnitude. Eg `amt:<0` or `amt:=100`. This works only
    with single-commodity amounts (multi-commodity amounts are
    always matched).
  - `tag:` can now match (exact, case sensitive) tag values. Eg `tag:TAG=REGEXP`.

add comand:

  - Transaction codes and comments (which may contain tags) can now be entered, following a date or amount respectively. ([#45](http://bugs.hledger.org/45))
  - The current entry may be restarted by entering `<` at any prompt. ([#47](http://bugs.hledger.org/47))
  - Entries are displayed and confirmed before they are written to the journal.
  - Default values may be specified for the first entry by providing them as command line arguments.
  - Miscellaneous UI cleanups

register command:

  - The `--related`/`-r` flag shows the other postings in each transaction, like ledger.
  - The `--width`/`-w` option increases or sets the output width.

web command:

  - The web command now also starts a browser, and auto-exits when unused, by default ("local ui mode").
    With `--server`, it keeps running and logs requests to the console ("server mode").
  - Bootstrap is now used for styling and layout
  - A favicon is served
  - The search field is wider
  - yesod devel is now supported; it uses `$LEDGER_FILE` or `~/.hledger.journal`
  - the `blaze_html_0_5` build flag has been reversed and renamed to `blaze_html_0_4`

Add-ons:

  - The hledger-interest and hledger-irr commands have been released/updated.
  - hledger-chart and hledger-vty remain unmaintained and deprecated.

Documentation and infrastructure:

  - The hledger docs and website have been reorganised and updated
  - Manuals for past releases are provided as well as the latest dev version
  - hledger has moved from darcs and darcs hub to git and github (!)
  - The bug tracker has moved from google code to github
  - Feature requests and project planning are now managed on trello
  - A build bot builds against multiple GHC versions on each commit

Release contributors:

- Sascha Welter commissioned register enhancements (--related and --width)
- David Patrick contributed a bounty for add enhancements
- Joachim Breitner added support for ! in status field
- Xinruo Sun provided hledger-web build fixes
- Peter Simons provided hledger-web build fixes, and a build bot
- Marko Kocić provided hledger-web fixes

## 2009/12/11 hledger 0.7

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.hledger/193)

  * price history support (first cut): P directives now work,
    though differently from ledger. Each posting amount takes its
    fixed unit price from the price history (or
    @) when available. This is simple and useful for things like
    foreign currency expenses (but not investment tracking). Like
    ledger, balance and register don't show amount prices any more, and
    don't separate differently-priced amounts. Unlike ledger, print
    shows all amount prices, and supports -B.
  * --effective option, will use transactions' effective dates if
    any
  * convert: new rules file format, find/create rules file
    automatically, more robust parsing, more useful --debug output
  * print: always sort by date, fix long account name truncation,
    align amounts, show end of line comments, show all amounts for
    clarity (don't elide the final balancing amount)
  * ui: use vty 4, fixes non-ascii and gnome terminal problems
    (issues [#3](http://bugs.hledger.org/3), [#4](http://bugs.hledger.org/4))
  * web: allow data entry, react to data file changes, better
    layout, help links, remove histogram command and filter fields for
    now, fix bad localhost redirect, filter form did not work in eg
    firefox (issue [#7](http://bugs.hledger.org/7)), reset link did not work in all browsers
  * parsing: require whitespace between date and status code, allow
    (and ignore) a time in price records, better error messages,
    non-zero exit code on parse failure
  * display non-ascii error messages properly (issue [#5](http://bugs.hledger.org/5))
  * fix an arithmetic bug that occasionally rejected valid
    transactions
  * fix a regex bug in showtree
  * don't break if HOME is undefined
  * --debug now implies --verbose
  * add functional tests like ledger's, use test-framework for
    speedy running, release shelltestrunner as a separate package
  * many hlint cleanups (Marko Kocić)
  * many site and documentation updates

## 2009/05/23 hledger 0.5

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.general/1181)

  * the vty flag is disabled by default again, to ease installation

## 2009/04/03 hledger 0.4

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.general/1097)
***There is also a new website at hledger.org, with screenshots (textual!),
a demo (will it survive!?), and docs (not too many!) ...
I wrote it because I did not want to hack on c++ and because haskell seemed a good fit ...
new happstack-based web interface.***

  * new "web" command serves reports in a web browser (install with
    -f happs to build this)
  * make the vty-based curses ui a cabal build option, which will
    be ignored on MS windows
  * drop the ..options-anywhere flag, that is now the default
  * patterns now use not: and desc: prefixes instead of \^ and \^\^
  * patterns are now case-insensitive, like ledger
  * !include directives are now relative to the including file (Tim
    Docker)
  * "Y2009" default year directives are now supported, allowing m/d
    dates in ledger
  * individual transactions now have a cleared status
  * unbalanced entries now cause a proper warning
  * balance report now passes all ledger compatibility tests
  * balance report now shows subtotals by default, like ledger 3
  * balance report shows the final zero total when -E is used
  * balance report hides the final total when ..no-total is used
  * ..depth affects print and register reports (aggregating with a
    reporting interval, filtering otherwise)
  * register report sorts transactions by date
  * register report shows zero-amount transactions when -E is used
  * provide more convenient timelog querying when invoked as
    "hours"
  * multi-day timelog sessions are split at midnight
  * unterminated timelog sessions are now counted. Accurate time
    reports at last!
  * the test command gives better ..verbose output
  * ..version gives more detailed version numbers including
    patchlevel for dev builds
  * new make targets include: ghci, haddocktest, doctest, unittest,
    view-api-docs
  * a doctest-style framework for functional/shell tests has been
    added

## 2009/01/17 hledger 0.3

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.hledger/67)

  * count timelog sessions on the day they end, like ledger, for
    now
  * when options are repeated, use the last instead of the first
  * builds with ghc 6.10 as well as 6.8
  * a simple ui for interactive report browsing: hledger ui
  * accept smart dates everywhere (YYYYMMDD, Y/M/D, Y, M/D, D, jan,
    today, last week etc.)
  * ..period/-p flag accepting period expressions like "in 2008",
    "weekly from last month"..
  * -W/-M/-Y convenience flags to summarise register weekly,
    monthly, yearly
  * ..depth and -E flags also affect summarised register reports
    (including depth=0)
  * ..display/-d flag supporting date predicates (like "d<[DATE]",
    "d\>=[DATE]")
  * !include directive to include additional ledger files
  * !account directive to set a default parent account
  * Added support for reading historical prices from files
  * timelog and ledger entries can be intermixed in one file
  * modifier and periodic entries can appear anywhere (but are
    still ignored)
  * help and readme improvements
  * runs much faster than 0.2

    month and day default to 1, separator can be / - or .)
  * -n flag for balance command
  * ..empty/-E flag

    emacs ledger-mode
  * allow any non-whitespace in account names, perhaps avoiding
    misleading missing amounts errors

## 2008/10/15 hledger 0.1

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.general/775)
***I'm pleased to announce the first release of hledger, a command-line
accounting tool similar to John Wiegley's c++ ledger. hledger generates
simple ledger-compatible transaction & account balance reports from a
plain text ledger file. It's simple to use, at least for techies.
This has been my "learning Haskell" project, but I think it's also
useful. It is much less featureful than ledger, and not quite as fast,
but it has the virtue of being fun for haskellers to hack on. I am
documenting the code, the app is simple, and I'm not too far up the
haskell learning curve, so I think other people learning haskell might
enjoy a look. It is currently ~1100 lines of haskell excluding tests.
My thanks to John Wiegley for help with compatibility and for his very
useful ledger tool. I use it (and now, both of them) daily to track time
and money. This is of course a hot topic around our planet. I hope you
find it useful or intriguing.***
