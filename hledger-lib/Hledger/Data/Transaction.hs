{-|

A 'Transaction' represents a movement of some commodity(ies) between two
or more accounts. It consists of multiple account 'Posting's which balance
to zero, a date, and optional extras like description, cleared status, and
tags.

Render a journal transaction as text similar to the style of Ledger's print command.

Adapted from Ledger 2.x and 3.x standard format:

@
yyyy-mm-dd[ *][ CODE] description.........          [  ; comment...............]
    account name 1.....................  ...$amount1[  ; comment...............]
    account name 2.....................  ..$-amount1[  ; comment...............]

pcodewidth    = no limit -- 10          -- mimicking ledger layout.
pdescwidth    = no limit -- 20          -- I don't remember what these mean,
pacctwidth    = 35 minimum, no maximum  -- they were important at the time.
pamtwidth     = 11
pcommentwidth = no limit -- 22
@

The output will be parseable journal syntax.
To facilitate this, postings with explicit multi-commodity amounts
are displayed as multiple similar postings, one per commodity.
(Normally does not happen with this function).

-- | Infer prices for this transaction's posting amounts, if needed to make
-- the postings balance, and if possible. This is done once for the real
-- postings and again (separately) for the balanced virtual postings. When
-- it's not possible, the transaction is left unchanged.
--
-- The simplest example is a transaction with two postings, each in a
-- different commodity, with no prices specified. In this case we'll add a
-- price to the first posting such that it can be converted to the commodity
-- of the second posting (with -B), and such that the postings balance.
--
-- In general, we can infer a conversion price when the sum of posting amounts
-- contains exactly two different commodities and no explicit prices.  Also
-- all postings are expected to contain an explicit amount (no missing
-- amounts) in a single commodity. Otherwise no price inferring is attempted.
--
-- The transaction itself could contain more than two commodities, and/or
-- prices, if they cancel out; what matters is that the sum of posting amounts
-- contains exactly two commodities and zero prices.
--
-- There can also be more than two postings in either of the commodities.
--
-- We want to avoid excessive display of digits when the calculated price is
-- an irrational number, while hopefully also ensuring the displayed numbers
-- make sense if the user does a manual calculation. This is (mostly) achieved
-- in two ways:
--
-- - when there is only one posting in the "from" commodity, a total price
--   (@@) is used, and all available decimal digits are shown
--
-- - otherwise, a suitable averaged unit price (@) is applied to the relevant
--   postings, with display precision equal to the summed display precisions
--   of the two commodities being converted between, or 2, whichever is larger.
--
-- (We don't always calculate a good-looking display precision for unit prices
-- when the commodity display precisions are low, eg when a journal doesn't
-- use any decimal places. The minimum of 2 helps make the prices shown by the
-- print command a bit less surprising in this case. Could do better.)
