demo

Play demos of hledger usage in the terminal, if asciinema is installed.

Flags:
  -s --speed=SPEED        playback speed (1 is original speed, .5 is half, 2
                          is double, etc (default: 2))

Run this command with no argument to list the demos. To play a demo,
write its number or a prefix or substring of its title. Tips:

Make your terminal window large enough to see the demo clearly.

Use the -s/--speed SPEED option to set your preferred playback speed, eg
-s4 to play at 4x original speed or -s.5 to play at half speed. The
default speed is 2x.

Other asciinema options can be added following a double dash, eg -- -i.1
to limit pauses or -- -h to list asciinema's other options.

During playback, several keys are available: SPACE to pause/unpause, .
to step forward (while paused), CTRL-c quit.

Examples:

$ hledger demo               # list available demos
$ hledger demo 1             # play the first demo at default speed (2x)
$ hledger demo install -s4   # play the "install" demo at 4x speed
