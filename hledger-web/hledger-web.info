hledger-web(1) hledger-web 1.13.99
**********************************

hledger-web is hledger's web interface.  It starts a simple web
application for browsing and adding transactions, and optionally opens
it in a web browser window if possible.  It provides a more
user-friendly UI than the hledger CLI or hledger-ui interface, showing
more at once (accounts, the current account register, balance charts)
and allowing history-aware data entry, interactive searching, and
bookmarking.

   hledger-web also lets you share a ledger with multiple users, or even
the public web.  There is no access control, so if you need that you
should put it behind a suitable web proxy.  As a small protection
against data loss when running an unprotected instance, it writes a
numbered backup of the main journal file (only ?)  on every edit.

   Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger
journal, timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or
'$LEDGER_FILE', or '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  For more about this see hledger(1),
hledger_journal(5) etc.

1 OPTIONS
*********

Command-line options and arguments may be used to set an initial filter
on the data.  These filter options are not shown in the web UI, but it
will be applied in addition to any search query entered there.

   Note: if invoking hledger-web as a hledger subcommand, write '--'
before options, as shown in the synopsis above.

'--serve'

     serve and log requests, don't browse or auto-exit
'--host=IPADDR'

     listen on this IP address (default: 127.0.0.1)
'--port=PORT'

     listen on this TCP port (default: 5000)
'--base-url=URL'

     set the base url (default: http://IPADDR:PORT). You would change
     this when sharing over the network, or integrating within a larger
     website.
'--file-url=URL'

     set the static files url (default: BASEURL/static).  hledger-web
     normally serves static files itself, but if you wanted to serve
     them from another server for efficiency, you would set the url with
     this.
'--capabilities=CAP[,CAP..]'

     enable the view, add, and/or manage capabilities (default:
     view,add)
'--capabilities-header=HTTPHEADER'

     read capabilities to enable from a HTTP header, like
     X-Sandstorm-Permissions (default: disabled)

   hledger input options:

'-f FILE --file=FILE'

     use a different input file.  For stdin, use - (default:
     '$LEDGER_FILE' or '$HOME/.hledger.journal')
'--rules-file=RULESFILE'

     Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)
'--separator=CHAR'

     Field separator to expect when reading CSV (default: ',')
'--alias=OLD=NEW'

     rename accounts named OLD to NEW
'--anon'

     anonymize accounts and payees
'--pivot FIELDNAME'

     use some other field or tag for the account name
'-I --ignore-assertions'

     ignore any failing balance assertions

   hledger reporting options:

'-b --begin=DATE'

     include postings/txns on or after this date
'-e --end=DATE'

     include postings/txns before this date
'-D --daily'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by day
'-W --weekly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by week
'-M --monthly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by month
'-Q --quarterly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by quarter
'-Y --yearly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by year
'-p --period=PERIODEXP'

     set start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
     using period expressions syntax (overrides the flags above)
'--date2'

     match the secondary date instead (see command help for other
     effects)
'-U --unmarked'

     include only unmarked postings/txns (can combine with -P or -C)
'-P --pending'

     include only pending postings/txns
'-C --cleared'

     include only cleared postings/txns
'-R --real'

     include only non-virtual postings
'-NUM --depth=NUM'

     hide/aggregate accounts or postings more than NUM levels deep
'-E --empty'

     show items with zero amount, normally hidden (and vice-versa in
     hledger-ui/hledger-web)
'-B --cost'

     convert amounts to their cost at transaction time (using the
     transaction price, if any)
'-V --value'

     convert amounts to their market value on the report end date (using
     the most recent applicable market price, if any)
'--auto'

     apply automated posting rules to modify transactions.
'--forecast'

     apply periodic transaction rules to generate future transactions,
     to 6 months from now or report end date.

   When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line,
the last one takes precedence.

   Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.

   hledger help options:

'-h --help'

     show general usage (or after COMMAND, command usage)
'--version'

     show version
'--debug[=N]'

     show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)

   A @FILE argument will be expanded to the contents of FILE, which
should contain one command line option/argument per line.  (To prevent
this, insert a '--' argument before.)

   By default, hledger-web starts the web app in "transient mode" and
also opens it in your default web browser if possible.  In this mode the
web app will keep running for as long as you have it open in a browser
window, and will exit after two minutes of inactivity (no requests and
no browser windows viewing it).  With '--serve', it just runs the web
app without exiting, and logs requests to the console.

   By default the server listens on IP address 127.0.0.1, accessible
only to local requests.  You can use '--host' to change this, eg '--host
0.0.0.0' to listen on all configured addresses.

   Similarly, use '--port' to set a TCP port other than 5000, eg if you
are running multiple hledger-web instances.

   You can use '--base-url' to change the protocol, hostname, port and
path that appear in hyperlinks, useful eg for integrating hledger-web
within a larger website.  The default is 'http://HOST:PORT/' using the
server's configured host address and TCP port (or 'http://HOST' if PORT
is 80).

   With '--file-url' you can set a different base url for static files,
eg for better caching or cookie-less serving on high performance
websites.

2 PERMISSIONS
*************

By default, hledger-web allows anyone who can reach it to view the
journal and to add new transactions, but not to change existing data.

   You can restrict who can reach it by

   * setting the IP address it listens on (see '--host' above).  By
     default it listens on 127.0.0.1, accessible to all users on the
     local machine.
   * putting it behind an authenticating proxy, using eg apache or nginx
   * custom firewall rules

   You can restrict what the users who reach it can do, by

   * using the '--capabilities=CAP[,CAP..]' flag when you start it,
     enabling one or more of the following capabilities.  The default
     value is 'view,add':
        * 'view' - allows viewing the journal file and all included
          files
        * 'add' - allows adding new transactions to the main journal
          file
        * 'manage' - allows editing, uploading or downloading the main
          or included files

   * using the '--capabilities-header=HTTPHEADER' flag to specify a HTTP
     header from which it will read capabilities to enable.  hledger-web
     on Sandstorm uses the X-Sandstorm-Permissions header to integrate
     with Sandstorm's permissions.  This is disabled by default.

3 EDITING, UPLOADING, DOWNLOADING
*********************************

If you enable the 'manage' capability mentioned above, you'll see a new
"spanner" button to the right of the search form.  Clicking this will
let you edit, upload, or download the journal file or any files it
includes.

   Note, unlike any other hledger command, in this mode you (or any
visitor) can alter or wipe the data files.

   Normally whenever a file is changed in this way, hledger-web saves a
numbered backup (assuming file permissions allow it, the disk is not
full, etc.)  hledger-web is not aware of version control systems,
currently; if you use one, you'll have to arrange to commit the changes
yourself (eg with a cron job or a file watcher like entr).

   Changes which would leave the journal file(s) unparseable or
non-valid (eg with failing balance assertions) are prevented.
(Probably.  This needs re-testing.)

4 RELOADING
***********

hledger-web detects changes made to the files by other means (eg if you
edit it directly, outside of hledger-web), and it will show the new data
when you reload the page or navigate to a new page.  If a change makes a
file unparseable, hledger-web will display an error message until the
file has been fixed.

5 JSON API
**********

In addition to the web UI, hledger-web provides some JSON API routes.
These are similar to the API provided by the hledger-api tool, but it
may be convenient to have them in hledger-web also.

/accountnames
/transactions
/prices
/commodities
/accounts
