#hledger is free, robust, friendly, fast, cross-platform, double-entry, multi-currency, multi-interface, GNU GPL-licensed, #plaintextaccounting software.
It is built around human-readable, version-controllable, future-proof plain text files.
The UIs will seem basic at first, but it is powerful, flexible, and fun to use.

It can help you learn bookkeeping, untangle accounting messes, track your financial status and history, 
run forecasts, set budgets and saving goals, produce detailed time reports, convert/transform financial data,
check the correctness of other systems, and create more balance and calm in your life.
It is a combination of accounting appliance, swiss army penknife, bootcamp/refresher course, and supportive community.
