hledger_timedot(5) hledger 1.15.99
**********************************

Timedot is a plain text format for logging dated, categorised quantities
(of time, usually), supported by hledger.  It is convenient for
approximate and retroactive time logging, eg when the real-time
clock-in/out required with a timeclock file is too precise or too
interruptive.  It can be formatted like a bar chart, making clear at a
glance where time was spent.

   Though called "timedot", this format is read by hledger as
commodityless quantities, so it could be used to represent dated
quantities other than time.  In the docs below we'll assume it's time.

1 FILE FORMAT
*************

A timedot file contains a series of day entries.  A day entry begins
with a date, and is followed by category/quantity pairs, one per line.
Dates are hledger-style simple dates (see hledger_journal(5)).
Categories are hledger-style account names, optionally indented.  As in
a hledger journal, there must be at least two spaces between the
category (account name) and the quantity.

   Quantities can be written as:

   * a sequence of dots (.)  representing quarter hours.  Spaces may
     optionally be used for grouping and readability.  Eg: ....  ..

   * an integral or decimal number, representing hours.  Eg: 1.5

   * an integral or decimal number immediately followed by a unit symbol
     's', 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w', 'mo', or 'y', representing seconds,
     minutes, hours, days weeks, months or years respectively.  Eg: 90m.
     The following equivalencies are assumed, currently: 1m = 60s, 1h =
     60m, 1d = 24h, 1w = 7d, 1mo = 30d, 1y=365d.

   Blank lines and lines beginning with #, ; or * are ignored.  An
example:

# on this day, 6h was spent on client work, 1.5h on haskell FOSS work, etc.

   Or with numbers:

   I prefer to use period for separating account components.  We can
make this work with an account alias:

2016/2/4
fos.hledger.timedot  4
fos.ledger           ..

$ hledger -f t.timedot --alias /\\./=: bal date:2016/2/4
                4.50  fos
                4.00    hledger:timedot
                0.50    ledger
--------------------
                4.50

   Here is a sample.timedot.
