{\tt hledger} is a set of cross-platform tools (and Haskell libraries) for tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple future-proof text file format.
It is an enhanced, well-documented reimplementation of plain text accounting in Haskell, inspired by John Wiegley's Ledger program.
{\tt hledger} aims to be a reliable and practical tool for daily use, and provides command-line, curses-style, and web interfaces.
{\tt hledger} is released under GNU GPLv3+.
