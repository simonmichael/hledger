**************************

This is hledger's command-line interface (there are also curses and web
interfaces). Its basic function is to read a plain text file describing
financial transactions (in accounting terms, a general journal) and
print useful reports on standard output, or export them as CSV. hledger
can also read some other file formats such as CSV files, translating
them to journal format. Additionally, hledger lists other hledger-*
executables found in the user's $PATH and can invoke them as
subcommands.

   hledger reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with `-f', or
`$LEDGER_FILE', or `$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
`C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal'). If using `$LEDGER_FILE', note this
must be a real environment variable, not a shell variable. You can
specify standard input with `-f-'.

   Transactions are dated movements of money between two (or more) named
accounts, and are recorded with journal entries like this:


2015/10/16 bought food
 expenses:food          $10
 assets:cash

   For more about this format, see hledger_journal(5).

   Most users use a text editor to edit the journal, usually with an
editor mode such as ledger-mode for added convenience. hledger's
interactive add command is another way to record new transactions.
hledger never changes existing transactions.

   To get started, you can either save some entries like the above in
`~/.hledger.journal', or run `hledger add' and follow the prompts. Then
try some commands like `hledger print' or `hledger balance'. See
COMMANDS and EXAMPLES below.

2 OPTIONS
*********

To see general usage and the command list: `hledger -h' or just
`hledger'. To see usage for a specific command: `hledger COMMAND -h'.

   hledger has several kinds of options:

   * General options are always available and can appear anywhere on the
     command line. `hledger -h' shows these. Eg: `hledger --version'.

   * Common reporting options are available with most commands. These
     and all other non-general options must be written after COMMAND.
     `hledger COMMAND -h' shows these. Eg: `hledger register --cleared'.

   * Command-specific options are also provided by some commands.
     `hledger COMMAND -h' shows these too. Eg: `hledger register
     --average'.

   * Some hledger commands come from separate add-on executables, which
     have their own options. `hledger COMMAND -h' shows these, as
     usual. Such options, if not also supported by hledger, should be
     written following a double hyphen argument (`--') so that
     hledger's option parser does not complain. Eg: `hledger ui --
     --register=checking'. Or, you can just run the add-on directly:
     `hledger-ui --register=checking'.


   Command arguments may also follow the command name. In most cases
these specify a query which filters the data. Command options and
arguments can be intermixed.

   Option and argument values containing problematic characters should
be escaped with double quotes, backslashes, or (best) single quotes.
This means spaces, but also characters which are significant to your
command shell, such as less-than/greater-than. Eg: `hledger register -p
'last year' "accounts receivable (receivable|payable)" amt:\>100'.

   Characters which are significant to the shell and also in regular
expressions, like parentheses, the pipe symbol and the dollar sign, must
sometimes be double-escaped. Eg, to match the dollar symbol: `hledger
balance cur:'\$'' or `hledger balance cur:\\$'.

   There's more.. options and arguments being passed by hledger to an
add-on executable get de-escaped once in the process. In this case you
might need triple-escaping. Eg: `hledger ui cur:'\\$'' or `hledger ui
cur:\\\\$'.

   If in doubt, keep things simple:

   * write options after the command

   * enclose problematic args in single quotes

   * if needed, also add a backslash to escape regexp metacharacters

   * run add-on executables directly

   If you're really curious, add `--debug=2' for troubleshooting.

   *General options:*

`-h'
     show general usage (or after COMMAND, the command's usage)

`--help'
     show the current program's manual as plain text (or after an add-on
     COMMAND, the add-on's manual)

`--man'
     show the current program's manual with man

`--info'
     show the current program's manual with info

`--version'
     show version

`--debug[=N]'
     show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)

`-f FILE --file=FILE'
     use a different input file. For stdin, use -

`--rules-file=RULESFILE'
     Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)

`--alias=OLD=NEW'
     display accounts named OLD as NEW

`-I --ignore-assertions'
     ignore any failing balance assertions in the journal

   *Common reporting options:*

`-b --begin=DATE'
     include postings/txns on or after this date

`-e --end=DATE'
     include postings/txns before this date

`-D --daily'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by day

`-W --weekly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by week

`-M --monthly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by month

`-Q --quarterly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by quarter

`-Y --yearly'
     multiperiod/multicolumn report by year

`-p --period=PERIODEXP'
     set start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
     (overrides the flags above)

`--date2'
     show, and match with -b/-e/-p/date:, secondary dates instead

`-C --cleared'
     include only cleared postings/txns

`--pending'
     include only pending postings/txns

`-U --uncleared'
     include only uncleared (and pending) postings/txns

`-R --real'
     include only non-virtual postings

`--depth=N'
     hide accounts/postings deeper than N

`-E --empty'
     show items with zero amount, normally hidden

`-B --cost'
     show amounts in their cost price's commodity

`--pivot TAG'
     will transform the journal before any other processing by
     replacing the account name of every posting having the tag TAG
     with content VALUE by the account name "TAG:VALUE".  The TAG will
     only match if it is a full-length match. The pivot will only
     happen if the TAG is on a posting, not if it is on the transaction.
     If the tag value is a multi:level:account:name the new account
     name will be "TAG:multi:level:account:name".

File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Multiple files,  Next: Repeated options,  Up: OPTIONS

2.1 Multiple files
==================

You can specify multiple `-f/--file FILE' options. This is like
combining all the files into one, except they can have different
formats. Also directives and aliases in one file do not affect
subsequent files (if you need that, use the include directive instead).


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Repeated options,  Next: Depth limiting,  Prev: Multiple files,  Up: OPTIONS

2.2 Repeated options
====================

Otherwise, if a reporting option is repeated, the last one takes
precedence. Eg -p jan -p feb is equivalent to -p feb.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Depth limiting,  Next: Smart dates,  Prev: Repeated options,  Up: OPTIONS

2.3 Depth limiting
==================

With the `--depth N' option, commands like account, balance and
register will show only the uppermost accounts in the account tree, down
to level N. Use this when you want a summary with less detail.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Smart dates,  Next: Report intervals,  Prev: Depth limiting,  Up: OPTIONS

2.4 Smart dates
===============

hledger's user interfaces accept a flexible "smart date" syntax (unlike
dates in the journal file). Smart dates allow some english words, can be
relative to today's date, and can have less-significant date parts
omitted (defaulting to 1).

   Examples:

`2009/1/1', `2009/01/01', `2009-1-1', `2009.1.1'   simple dates, several separators allowed
`2009/1', `2009'                                   same as above - a missing day or month defaults to 1
`1/1', `january', `jan', `this year'               relative dates, meaning january 1 of the current year
`next year'                                        january 1 of next year
`this month'                                       the 1st of the current month
`this week'                                        the most recent monday
`last week'                                        the monday of the week before this one
`lastweek'                                         spaces are optional
`today', `yesterday', `tomorrow'                   


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Report intervals,  Next: Period expressions,  Prev: Smart dates,  Up: OPTIONS

2.5 Report intervals
====================

A report interval can be specified so that commands like register,
balance and activity will divide their reports into multiple subperiods.
The basic intervals can be selected with one of `-D/--daily',
`-W/--weekly', `-M/--monthly', `-Q/--quarterly', or `-Y/--yearly'. More
complex intervals may be specified with a period expression.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Period expressions,  Next: Regular expressions,  Prev: Report intervals,  Up: OPTIONS

2.6 Period expressions
======================

The `-p/--period' option accepts period expressions, a shorthand way of
expressing a start date, end date, and/or report interval all at once.

   Here's a basic period expression specifying the first quarter of
2009.  Note, hledger always treats start dates as inclusive and end
dates as exclusive:

   `-p "from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"'

   Keywords like "from" and "to" are optional, and so are the spaces, as
long as you don't run two dates together. "to" can also be written as
"-". These are equivalent to the above:

`-p "2009/1/1 2009/4/1"'
`-p2009/1/1to2009/4/1'
`-p2009/1/1-2009/4/1'

   Dates are smart dates, so if the current year is 2009, the above can
also be written as:

`-p "1/1 4/1"'
`-p "january-apr"'
`-p "this year to 4/1"'

   If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be
the earliest or latest transaction in your journal:

`-p "from 2009/1/1"'   everything after january 1, 2009
`-p "from 2009/1"'     the same
`-p "from 2009"'       the same
`-p "to 2009"'         everything before january 1, 2009

   A single date with no "from" or "to" defines both the start and end
date like so:

`-p "2009"'       the year 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2010/1/1"
`-p "2009/1"'     the month of jan; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/2/1"
`-p "2009/1/1"'   just that day; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/1/2"

   The argument of `-p' can also begin with, or be, a report interval
expression. The basic report intervals are `daily', `weekly',
`monthly', `quarterly', or `yearly', which have the same effect as the
`-D',`-W',`-M',`-Q', or `-Y' flags. Between report interval and
start/end dates (if any), the word `in' is optional. Examples:

`-p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"'
`-p "monthly in 2008"'
`-p "quarterly"'

   The following more complex report intervals are also supported:
`biweekly', `bimonthly', `every N days|weeks|months|quarters|years',
`every Nth day [of month]', `every Nth day of week'.

   Examples:

`-p "bimonthly from 2008"'
`-p "every 2 weeks"'
`-p "every 5 days from 1/3"'

   Show historical balances at end of 15th each month (N is exclusive
end date):

   `hledger balance -H -p "every 16th day"'

   Group postings from start of wednesday to end of next tuesday (N is
start date and exclusive end date):

   `hledger register checking -p "every 3rd day of week"'


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Regular expressions,  Prev: Period expressions,  Up: OPTIONS

2.7 Regular expressions
=======================

hledger uses regular expressions in a number of places:

   * query terms, on the command line and in the hledger-web search
     form: `REGEX', `desc:REGEX', `cur:REGEX', `tag:...=REGEX'

   * CSV rules conditional blocks: `if REGEX ...'

   * account alias directives and options: `alias /REGEX/ =
     REPLACEMENT', `--alias /REGEX/=REPLACEMENT'

   hledger's regular expressions come from the regex-tdfa library. In
general they:

   * are case insensitive

   * are infix matching (do not need to match the entire thing being
     matched)

   * are POSIX extended regular expressions

   * also support GNU word boundaries (\<, \>, \b, \B)

   * and parenthesised capturing groups and numeric backreferences in
     replacement strings

   * do not support mode modifiers like (?s)

   Some things to note:

   * In the `alias' directive and `--alias' option, regular expressions
     must be enclosed in forward slashes (`/REGEX/').  Elsewhere in
     hledger, these are not required.

   * To match a regular expression metacharacter like `$' as a literal
     character, prepend a backslash. Eg to search for amounts with the
     dollar sign in hledger-web, write `cur:\$'.

   * On the command line, some metacharacters like `$' have a special
     meaning to the shell and so must be escaped a second time, with
     single or double quotes or another backslash. Eg, to match amounts
     with the dollar sign from the command line, write `cur:'\$'' or
     `cur:\\$'.

3 QUERIES
*********

One of hledger's strengths is being able to quickly report on precise
subsets of your data. Most commands accept an optional query expression,
written as arguments after the command name, to filter the data by date,
account name or other criteria. The syntax is similar to a web search:
one or more space-separated search terms, quotes to enclose whitespace,
optional prefixes to match specific fields. Multiple search terms are
combined as follows:

   All commands except print: show transactions/postings/accounts which
match (or negatively match)

   * any of the description terms AND

   * any of the account terms AND

   * all the other terms.

   The print command: show transactions which

   * match any of the description terms AND

   * have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND

   * have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND

   * match all the other terms.

   The following kinds of search terms can be used:

*`REGEX'*
     match account names by this regular expression

*`acct:REGEX'*
     same as above

*`amt:N, amt:<N, amt:<=N, amt:>N, amt:>=N'*
     match postings with a single-commodity amount that is equal to,
     less than, or greater than N. (Multi-commodity amounts are not
     tested, and will always match.) The comparison has two modes: if N
     is preceded by a + or - sign (or is 0), the two signed numbers are
     compared. Otherwise, the absolute magnitudes are compared,
     ignoring sign.

*`code:REGEX'*
     match by transaction code (eg check number)

*`cur:REGEX'*
     match postings or transactions including any amounts whose
     currency/commodity symbol is fully matched by REGEX. (For a partial
     match, use `.*REGEX.*'). Note, to match characters which are
     regex-significant, like the dollar sign (`$'), you need to prepend
     `\'. And when using the command line you need to add one more level
     of quoting to hide it from the shell, so eg do: `hledger print
     cur:'\$'' or `hledger print cur:\\$'.

*`desc:REGEX'*
     match transaction descriptions

*`date:PERIODEXPR'*
     match dates within the specified period. PERIODEXPR is a period
     expression (with no report interval). Examples: `date:2016',
     `date:thismonth', `date:2000/2/1-2/15', `date:lastweek-'.  If the
     `--date2' command line flag is present, this matches secondary
     dates instead.

*`date2:PERIODEXPR'*
     match secondary dates within the specified period.

*`depth:N'*
     match (or display, depending on command) accounts at or above this
     depth

*`real:, real:0'*
     match real or virtual postings respectively

*`status:*, status:!, status:'*
     match cleared, pending, or uncleared/pending transactions
     respectively

*`tag:REGEX[=REGEX]'*
     match by tag name, and optionally also by tag value. Note a tag:
     query is considered to match a transaction if it matches any of
     the postings.  Also remember that postings inherit the tags of
     their parent transaction.

*`not:'*
     before any of the above negates the match.

*`inacct:ACCTNAME'*
     a special term used automatically when you click an account name in
     hledger-web, specifying the account register we are currently in
     (selects the transactions of that account and how to show them,
     can be filtered further with `acct' etc). Not supported elsewhere
     in hledger.

   Some of these can also be expressed as command-line options (eg
`depth:2' is equivalent to `--depth 2'). Generally you can mix options
and query arguments, and the resulting query will be their intersection
(perhaps excluding the `-p/--period' option).

4 COMMANDS
**********

hledger provides a number of subcommands; `hledger' with no arguments
shows a list.

   If you install additional `hledger-*' packages, or if you put
programs or scripts named `hledger-NAME' in your PATH, these will also
be listed as subcommands.

   Run a subcommand by writing its name as first argument (eg `hledger
incomestatement'). You can also write any unambiguous prefix of a
command name (`hledger inc'), or one of the standard short aliases
displayed in the command list (`hledger is').

4.1 accounts
============

Show account names.

`--tree'
     show short account names, as a tree

`--flat'
     show full account names, as a list (default)

`--drop=N'
     in flat mode: omit N leading account name parts

   This command lists all account names that are in use (ie, all the
accounts which have at least one transaction posting to them). With
query arguments, only matched account names are shown.

   It shows a flat list by default. With `--tree', it uses indentation
to show the account hierarchy.

   In flat mode you can add `--drop N' to omit the first few account
name components.

   Examples:


$ hledger accounts --tree
assets
  bank
    checking
    saving
  cash
expenses
  food
  supplies
income
  gifts
  salary
liabilities
  debts


$ hledger accounts --drop 1

4.2 activity
============

Show an ascii barchart of posting counts per interval.

   The activity command displays an ascii histogram showing transaction
counts by day, week, month or other reporting interval (by day is the
default). With query arguments, it counts only matched transactions.


$ hledger activity --quarterly
2008-01-01 **

4.3 add
=======

Prompt for transactions and add them to the journal.

`--no-new-accounts'
     don't allow creating new accounts; helps prevent typos when
     entering account names

   Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor,
or generate them from CSV. For more interactive data entry, there is the
`add' command, which prompts interactively on the console for new
transactions, and appends them to the journal file (if there are
multiple `-f FILE' options, the first file is used.) Existing
transactions are not changed. This is the only hledger command that
writes to the journal file.

   To use it, just run `hledger add' and follow the prompts. You can
add as many transactions as you like; when you are finished, enter `.'
or press control-d or control-c to exit.

   Features:

   * add tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar recent
     transaction (by description) as a template.

   * You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.

   * Readline-style edit keys can be used during data entry.

   * The tab key will auto-complete whenever possible - accounts,
     descriptions, dates (`yesterday', `today', `tomorrow').  If the
     input area is empty, it will insert the default value.

   * If the journal defines a default commodity, it will be added to
     any bare numbers entered.

   * A parenthesised transaction code may be entered following a date.

   * Comments and tags may be entered following a description or amount.

   * If you make a mistake, enter `<' at any prompt to restart the
     transaction.

   * Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when the terminal
     supports it.

   Example (see the tutorial for a detailed explanation):


$ hledger add
Adding transactions to journal file /src/hledger/data/sample.journal
Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.

4.4 balance
===========

Show accounts and their balances. Alias: bal.

`--change'
     show balance change in each period (default)

`--cumulative'
     show balance change accumulated across periods (in multicolumn
     reports)

`-H --historical'
     show historical ending balance in each period (includes postings
     before report start date)

`--tree'
     show accounts as a tree; amounts include subaccounts (default in
     simple reports)

`--flat'
     show accounts as a list; amounts exclude subaccounts except when
     account is depth-clipped (default in multicolumn reports)

`-V --value'
     convert amounts to current market value in their default valuation
     commodity

`-A --average'
     show a row average column (in multicolumn mode)

`-T --row-total'
     show a row total column (in multicolumn mode)

`-N --no-total'
     don't show the final total row

`--drop=N'
     omit N leading account name parts (in flat mode)

`--no-elide'
     don't squash boring parent accounts (in tree mode)

`--format=LINEFORMAT'
     in single-column balance reports: use this custom line format

`-O FMT --output-format=FMT'
     select the output format. Supported formats: txt, csv.

`-o FILE --output-file=FILE'
     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.

   The balance command displays accounts and balances. It is hledger's
most featureful and most useful command.


$ hledger balance
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0

   More precisely, the balance command shows the _change_ to each
account's balance caused by all (matched) postings. In the common case
where you do not filter by date and your journal sets the correct
opening balances, this is the same as the account's ending balance.

   By default, accounts are displayed hierarchically, with subaccounts
indented below their parent. "Boring" accounts, which contain a single
interesting subaccount and no balance of their own, are elided into the
following line for more compact output. (Use `--no-elide' to prevent
this.)

   Each account's balance is the "inclusive" balance - it includes the
balances of any subaccounts.

   Accounts which have zero balance (and no non-zero subaccounts) are
omitted. Use `-E/--empty' to show them.

   A final total is displayed by default; use `-N/--no-total' to
suppress it:


$ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses --no-total
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies

4.4.1 Flat mode
---------------

To see a flat list of full account names instead of the default
hierarchical display, use `--flat'. In this mode, accounts (unless
depth-clipped) show their "exclusive" balance, excluding any subaccount
balances. In this mode, you can also use `--drop N' to omit the first
few account name components.


$ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses -N --flat --drop 1
                  $1  food
                  $1  supplies


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Depth limited balance reports,  Next: Multicolumn balance reports,  Prev: Flat mode,  Up: balance

4.4.2 Depth limited balance reports
-----------------------------------

With `--depth N', balance shows accounts only to the specified depth.
This is very useful to show a complex charts of accounts in less
detail. In flat mode, balances from accounts below the depth limit will
be shown as part of a parent account at the depth limit.


$ hledger balance -N --depth 1
                 $-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $-2  income
                  $1  liabilities


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Multicolumn balance reports,  Next: Market value,  Prev: Depth limited balance reports,  Up: balance

4.4.3 Multicolumn balance reports
---------------------------------

With a reporting interval, multiple balance columns will be shown, one
for each report period. There are three types of multi-column balance
report, showing different information:

  1. By default: each column shows the sum of postings in that period,
     ie the account's change of balance in that period. This is useful
     eg for a monthly income statement:


     $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E
     Balance changes in 2008:

                        ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4
     ===================++=================================
      expenses:food     ||       0      $1       0       0
      expenses:supplies ||       0      $1       0       0
      income:gifts      ||       0     $-1       0       0
      income:salary     ||     $-1       0       0       0
     -------------------++---------------------------------
                        ||     $-1      $1       0       0

  2. With `--cumulative': each column shows the ending balance for that
     period, accumulating the changes across periods, starting from 0
     at the report start date:


     $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E --cumulative
     Ending balances (cumulative) in 2008:

                        ||  2008/03/31  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31
     ===================++=================================================
      expenses:food     ||           0          $1          $1          $1
      expenses:supplies ||           0          $1          $1          $1
      income:gifts      ||           0         $-1         $-1         $-1
      income:salary     ||         $-1         $-1         $-1         $-1
     -------------------++-------------------------------------------------
                        ||         $-1           0           0           0

  3. With `--historical/-H': each column shows the actual historical
     ending balance for that period, accumulating the changes across
     periods, starting from the actual balance at the report start
     date. This is useful eg for a multi-period balance sheet, and when
     you are showing only the data after a certain start date:


     $ hledger balance ^assets ^liabilities --quarterly --historical --begin 2008/4/1
     Ending balances (historical) in 2008/04/01-2008/12/31:

                           ||  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31
     ======================++=====================================
      assets:bank:checking ||          $1          $1           0
      assets:bank:saving   ||          $1          $1          $1
      assets:cash          ||         $-2         $-2         $-2
      liabilities:debts    ||           0           0          $1
     ----------------------++-------------------------------------
                           ||           0           0           0


   Multi-column balance reports display accounts in flat mode by
default; to see the hierarchy, use `--tree'.

   With a reporting interval (like `--quarterly' above), the report
start/end dates will be adjusted if necessary so that they encompass the
displayed report periods. This is so that the first and last periods
will be "full" and comparable to the others.

   The `-E/--empty' flag does two things in multicolumn balance
reports: first, the report will show all columns within the specified
report period (without -E, leading and trailing columns with all zeroes
are not shown). Second, all accounts which existed at the report start
date will be considered, not just the ones with activity during the
report period (use -E to include low-activity accounts which would
otherwise would be omitted).

   The `-T/--row-total' flag adds an additional column showing the
total for each row.

   The `-A/--average' flag adds a column showing the average value in
each row.

   Here's an example of all three:


$ hledger balance -Q income expenses --tree -ETA
Balance changes in 2008:

            ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4    Total  Average
============++===================================================
 expenses   ||       0      $2       0       0       $2       $1
   food     ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0
   supplies ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0
 income     ||     $-1     $-1       0       0      $-2      $-1
   gifts    ||       0     $-1       0       0      $-1        0
   salary   ||     $-1       0       0       0      $-1        0
------------++---------------------------------------------------
            ||     $-1      $1       0       0        0        0

# Average is rounded to the dollar here since all journal amounts are


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Market value,  Next: Custom balance output,  Prev: Multicolumn balance reports,  Up: balance

4.4.4 Market value
------------------

The `-V/--value' flag converts all the reported amounts to their
"current market value" using their default market price. That is the
latest market price (P directive) found in the journal (or an included
file), for the amount's commodity, dated on or before the report end
date.

   Unlike Ledger, hledger's -V only uses the market prices recorded
with P directives, ignoring transaction prices recorded as part of
posting amounts (which -B/-cost uses). Using -B and -V together is
allowed.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Custom balance output,  Next: Output destination,  Prev: Market value,  Up: balance

4.4.5 Custom balance output
---------------------------

In simple (non-multi-column) balance reports, you can customise the
output with `--format FMT':


$ hledger balance --format "%20(account) %12(total)"
              assets          $-1
         bank:saving           $1
                cash          $-2
            expenses           $2
                food           $1
            supplies           $1
              income          $-2
               gifts          $-1
              salary          $-1
   liabilities:debts           $1
---------------------------------
                                0

   The FMT format string (plus a newline) specifies the formatting
applied to each account/balance pair. It may contain any suitable text,
with data fields interpolated like so:

   `%[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)'

   * MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)

   * MAX truncates at this width (optional)

   * FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:

        * `depth_spacer' - a number of spaces equal to the account's
          depth, or if MIN is specified, MIN * depth spaces.

        * `account' - the account's name

        * `total' - the account's balance/posted total, right justified


   Also, FMT can begin with an optional prefix to control how
multi-commodity amounts are rendered:

   * `%_' - render on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)

   * `%^' - render on multiple lines, top-aligned

   * `%,' - render on one line, comma-separated

   There are some quirks. Eg in one-line mode, `%(depth_spacer)' has no
effect, instead `%(account)' has indentation built in.  Experimentation
may be needed to get pleasing results.

   Some example formats:

   * `%(total)' - the account's total

   * `%-20.20(account)' - the account's name, left justified, padded to
     20 characters and clipped at 20 characters

   * `%,%-50(account)  %25(total)' - account name padded to 50
     characters, total padded to 20 characters, with multiple
     commodities rendered on one line

   * `%20(total)  %2(depth_spacer)%-(account)' - the default format for
     the single-column balance report


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Output destination,  Next: CSV output,  Prev: Custom balance output,  Up: balance

4.4.6 Output destination
------------------------

The balance, print, register and stats commands can write their output
to a destination other than the console. This is controlled by the
`-o/--output-file' option.


$ hledger balance -o -     # write to stdout (the default)
$ hledger balance -o FILE  # write to FILE


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: CSV output,  Prev: Output destination,  Up: balance

4.4.7 CSV output
----------------

The balance, print and register commands can write their output as CSV.
This is useful for exporting data to other applications, eg to make
charts in a spreadsheet. This is controlled by the `-O/--output-format'
option, or by specifying a `.csv' file extension with
`-o/--output-file'.


$ hledger balance -O csv       # write CSV to stdout
$ hledger balance -o FILE.csv  # write CSV to FILE.csv

`--flat'
     show full account names, as a list (default)

`--drop=N'
     in flat mode: omit N leading account name parts

   This command displays a simple balance sheet. It currently assumes
that you have top-level accounts named `asset' and `liability' (plural
forms also allowed.)


$ hledger balancesheet

============

Show a cashflow statement. Alias: cf.

`--flat'
     show full account names, as a list (default)

`--drop=N'
     in flat mode: omit N leading account name parts

   This command displays a simple cashflow statement It shows the
change in all "cash" (ie, liquid assets) accounts for the period. It
currently assumes that cash accounts are under a top-level account named
`asset' and do not contain `receivable' or `A/R' (plural forms also
allowed.)


$ hledger cashflow

4.7 help
========

Show any of the hledger manuals.

   The `help' command displays any of the main hledger man pages.
(Unlike `hledger --help', which displays only the hledger man page.)
Run it with no arguments to list available topics (their names are
shortened for easier typing), and run `hledger help TOPIC' to select
one. The output is similar to a man page, but fixed width. It may be
long, so you may wish to pipe it into a pager. See also info and man.


$ hledger help

4.9 info
========

Show any of the hledger manuals using info.

   The `info' command displays any of the hledger reference manuals
using the info hypertextual documentation viewer. This can be a very
efficient way to browse large manuals. It requires the "info" program to
be available in your PATH.

   As with help, run it with no arguments to list available topics
(manuals).


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: man,  Next: print,  Prev: info,  Up: COMMANDS

4.10 man
========

Show any of the hledger manuals using man.

   The `man' command displays any of the hledger reference manuals
using man, the standard documentation viewer on unix systems. This will
fit the text to your terminal width, and probably invoke a pager
automatically. It requires the "man" program to be available in your
PATH.

   As with help, run it with no arguments to list available topics
(manuals).


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: print,  Next: register,  Prev: man,  Up: COMMANDS

4.11 print
==========

Show transactions from the journal.

`-m STR --match=STR'
     show the transaction whose description is most similar to STR, and
     is most recent

`-O FMT --output-format=FMT'
     select the output format. Supported formats: txt, csv.

`-o FILE --output-file=FILE'
     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.


$ hledger print
2008/01/01 income
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:salary                  $-1

2008/12/31 * pay off
    liabilities:debts               $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1

   The print command displays full transactions from the journal file,
tidily formatted and showing all amounts explicitly. The output of print
is always a valid hledger journal, but it does always not preserve all
original content exactly (eg directives).

   hledger's print command also shows all unit prices in effect, or
(with -B/-cost) shows cost amounts.

   The print command also supports output destination and CSV output.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: register,  Next: stats,  Prev: print,  Up: COMMANDS

4.12 register
=============

Show postings and their running total. Alias: reg.

`--cumulative'
     show running total from report start date (default)

`-H --historical'
     show historical running total/balance (includes postings before
     report start date)

`-A --average'
     show running average of posting amounts instead of total (implies
     -empty)

`-r --related'
     show postings' siblings instead

`-w N --width=N'
     set output width (default: terminal width or COLUMNS. -wN,M sets
     description width as well)

`-O FMT --output-format=FMT'
     select the output format. Supported formats: txt, csv.

`-o FILE --output-file=FILE'
     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.

   The register command displays postings, one per line, and their
running total. This is typically used with a query selecting a
particular account, to see that account's activity:


$ hledger register checking
2008/01/01 income               assets:bank:checking            $1            $1

2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1             0

   The `--historical'/`-H' flag adds the balance from any undisplayed
prior postings to the running total. This is useful when you want to
see only recent activity, with a historically accurate running balance:


$ hledger register checking -b 2008/6 --historical
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1            $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1            $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1             0

   The `--depth' option limits the amount of sub-account detail
displayed.

   The `--average'/`-A' flag shows the running average posting amount
instead of the running total (so, the final number displayed is the
average for the whole report period). This flag implies `--empty' (see
below). It is affected by `--historical'. It works best when showing
just one account and one commodity.

   The `--related'/`-r' flag shows the _other_ postings in the
transactions of the postings which would normally be shown.

   With a reporting interval, register shows summary postings, one per
interval, aggregating the postings to each account:


$ hledger register --monthly income
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1           $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1           $-2

   Periods with no activity, and summary postings with a zero amount,
are not shown by default; use the `--empty'/`-E' flag to see them:


$ hledger register --monthly income -E
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1           $-1
2008/02                                                          0           $-1

2008/08                                                          0           $-2
2008/09                                                          0           $-2
2008/10                                                          0           $-2
2008/11                                                          0           $-2
2008/12                                                          0           $-2

   Often, you'll want to see just one line per interval. The `--depth'
option helps with this, causing subaccounts to be aggregated:


$ hledger register --monthly assets --depth 1h
2008/01                 assets                                  $1            $1
2008/06                 assets                                 $-1             0
2008/12                 assets                                 $-1           $-1

   Note when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates
these will be adjusted outward if necessary to contain a whole number of
intervals. This ensures that the first and last intervals are full
length and comparable to the others in the report.

File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Custom register output,  Up: register

4.12.1 Custom register output
-----------------------------

register uses the full terminal width by default, except on windows. You
can override this by setting the `COLUMNS' environment variable (not a
bash shell variable) or by using the `--width'/`-w' option.

   The description and account columns normally share the space equally
(about half of (width - 40) each). You can adjust this by adding a
description width as part of -width's argument, comma-separated:
`--width W,D' . Here's a diagram:


<--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA

   and some examples:


$ hledger reg                     # use terminal width (or 80 on windows)
$ hledger reg -w 100              # use width 100
$ COLUMNS=100 hledger reg         # set with one-time environment variable
$ export COLUMNS=100; hledger reg # set till session end (or window resize)
$ hledger reg -w 100,40           # set overall width 100, description width 40
$ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,40      # use terminal width, and set description width

   The register command also supports the `-o/--output-file' and
`-O/--output-format' options for controlling output destination and CSV
output.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: stats,  Next: test,  Prev: register,  Up: COMMANDS

4.13 stats
==========

Show some journal statistics.

`-o FILE --output-file=FILE'
     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.


$ hledger stats
Main journal file        : /src/hledger/data/sample.journal
Included journal files   :
Transactions span        : 2008-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (366 days)
Last transaction         : 2008-12-31 (2333 days ago)
Transactions             : 5 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions      : 5
Accounts                 : 8 (depth 3)
Commodities              : 1 ($)

   The stats command displays summary information for the whole
journal, or a matched part of it. With a reporting interval, it shows a
report for each report period.

   The stats command also supports `-o/--output-file' for controlling
output destination.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: test,  Prev: stats,  Up: COMMANDS

4.14 test
=========

Run built-in unit tests.


$ hledger test
Cases: 74  Tried: 74  Errors: 0  Failures: 0

   This command runs hledger's built-in unit tests and displays a quick
report. With a regular expression argument, it selects only tests with
matching names. It's mainly used in development, but it's also nice to
be able to check your hledger executable for smoke at any time.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: ADD-ON COMMANDS,  Next: TROUBLESHOOTING,  Prev: COMMANDS,  Up: Top

5 ADD-ON COMMANDS
*****************

Add-on commands are executables in your PATH whose name starts with
`hledger-' and ends with any of these file extensions: none,
`.hs',`.lhs',`.pl',`.py',`.rb',`.rkt',`.sh',`.bat',`.com',`.exe'.
Also, an add-on's name may not be the same as any built-in command or
alias.

   hledger will detect these and include them in the command list and
let you invoke them with `hledger ADDONCMD'. However there are some
limitations:

   * Options appearing before ADDONCMD will be visible only to hledger
     and will not be passed to the add-on. Eg: `hledger -h web' shows
     hledger's usage, `hledger web -h' shows hledger-web's usage.

   * Options understood only by the add-on must go after a `--' argument
     to hide them from hledger, which would otherwise reject them. Eg:
     `hledger web -- --server'.

   Sometimes it may be more convenient to just run the add-on directly,
eg: `hledger-web --server'.

   Add-ons which are written in haskell can take advantage of the
hledger-lib library for journal parsing, reporting, command-line
options, etc.

   Here are some hledger add-ons available from Hackage, the extra
directory in the hledger source, or elsewhere:

   ledger-autosync, which includes a `hledger-autosync' alias,
downloads transactions from your bank(s) via OFX, and prints just the
new ones as journal entries which you can add to your journal. It can
also operate on .OFX files which you've downloaded manually. It can be a
nice alternative to hledger's built-in CSV reader, especially if your
bank supports OFX download.

5.3 diff
========

Show transactions present in one journal file but not another


$ hledger diff --help
Usage: hledger-diff account:name left.journal right.journal
$ cat a.journal
1/1
 (acct:one)  1

$ cat b.journal
1/1
 (acct:one)  1
2/2
 (acct:two)  2

$ hledger diff acct:two a.journal b.journal
Unmatched transactions in the first journal:

Unmatched transactions in the second journal:

2015/02/02
    (acct:two)            $2

   hledger-diff compares two journal files. Given an account name, it
prints out the transactions affecting that account which are in one
journal file but not in the other. This can be useful for reconciling
existing journals with bank statements.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: equity,  Next: interest,  Prev: diff,  Up: ADD-ON COMMANDS

5.4 equity
==========

Print a journal entry that resets account balances to zero.


$ hledger balance --flat -E assets liabilities
                   0  assets:bank:checking
                  $1  assets:bank:saving
                 $-2  assets:cash
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0
$ hledger equity assets liabilities
2015/05/23
    assets:bank:saving                $-1
    assets:cash                        $2
    liabilities:debts                 $-1
    equity:closing balances             0

2015/05/23
    assets:bank:saving                 $1
    assets:cash                       $-2
    liabilities:debts                  $1
    equity:opening balances             0

   This prints a journal entry which zeroes out the specified accounts
(or all accounts) with a transfer to/from "equity:closing balances"
(like Ledger's equity command). Also, it prints an similar entry with
opposite sign for restoring the balances from "equity:opening balances".

   These can be useful for ending one journal file and starting a new
one, respectively. By zeroing your asset and liability accounts at the
end of a file and restoring them at the start of the next one, you will
see correct asset/liability balances whether you run hledger on just one
file, or on several files concatenated with include.

   hledger-interest computes interests for a given account. Using
command line flags, the program can be configured to use various
schemes for day-counting, such as act/act, 30/360, 30E/360, and
30/360isda.  Furthermore, it supports a (small) number of interest
schemes, i.e.  annual interest with a fixed rate and the scheme
mandated by the German BGB288 (Basiszins für Verbrauchergeschäfte).

   hledger-irr computes the internal rate of return, also known as the
effective interest rate, of a given investment. After specifying what
account holds the investment, and what account stores the gains (or
losses, or fees, or cost), it calculates the hypothetical annual rate of
fixed rate investment that would have provided the exact same cash flow.

5.8 rewrite
===========

Prints all journal entries, adding specified custom postings to matched
entries.

   hledger-rewrite.hs, in hledger's extra directory (compilation
optional), adds postings to existing transactions, optionally with an
amount based on the existing transaction's first amount. See the script
for more details.


$ hledger rewrite -- [QUERY]        --add-posting "ACCT  AMTEXPR" ...
$ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'
$ hledger rewrite -- expenses:gifts --add-posting '(budget:gifts)  *-1"'

6.1 Run-time problems
=====================

Here are some issues you might encounter when you run hledger (and
remember you can also seek help from the IRC channel, mail list or bug
tracker):

   *Successfully installed, but "No command 'hledger' found"*
stack and cabal install binaries into a special directory, which should
be added to your PATH environment variable. Eg on unix-like systems,
that is ~/.local/bin and ~/.cabal/bin respectively.

   *I set a custom LEDGER_FILE, but hledger is still using the default
file*
`LEDGER_FILE' should be a real environment variable, not just a shell
variable. The command `env | grep LEDGER_FILE' should show it. You may
need to use `export'. Here's an explanation.

   *"Illegal byte sequence" or "Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide
character" errors*
In order to handle non-ascii letters and symbols (like £), hledger
needs an appropriate locale. This is usually configured system-wide;
you can also configure it temporarily. The locale may need to be one
that supports UTF-8, if you built hledger with GHC < 7.2 (or possibly
always, I'm not sure yet).

   Here's an example of setting the locale temporarily, on ubuntu
gnu/linux:


$ file my.journal
my.journal: UTF-8 Unicode text                 # <- the file is UTF8-encoded
$ locale -a
C
en_US.utf8                             # <- a UTF8-aware locale is available
POSIX
$ LANG=en_US.utf8 hledger -f my.journal print   # <- use it for this command

   Here's one way to set it permanently, there are probably better ways:


$ echo "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8" >>~/.bash_profile
$ bash --login

   If we preferred to use eg `fr_FR.utf8', we might have to install
that first:


$ apt-get install language-pack-fr
$ locale -a
C
en_US.utf8
fr_BE.utf8
fr_CA.utf8
fr_CH.utf8
fr_FR.utf8
fr_LU.utf8
POSIX
$ LANG=fr_FR.utf8 hledger -f my.journal print

   Note some platforms allow variant locale spellings, but not all
(ubuntu accepts `fr_FR.UTF8', mac osx requires exactly `fr_FR.UTF-8').

6.2 Known limitations
=====================

*Command line interface*

   Add-on command options, unless they are also understood by the main
hledger executable, must be written after `--', like this: `hledger web
-- --server'

   *Differences from Ledger*

   Not all of Ledger's journal file syntax is supported. See file format
differences.

   hledger is slower than Ledger, and uses more memory, on large data
files.

   *Windows limitations*

   In a windows CMD window, non-ascii characters and colours are not
supported.

   In a windows Cygwin/MSYS/Mintty window, the tab key is not supported
in hledger add.
