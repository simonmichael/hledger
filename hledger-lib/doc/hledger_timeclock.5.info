hledger_timeclock(5) hledger 0.28
*********************************

hledger can read timeclock files. As with Ledger, these are (a subset
of) timeclock.el's format, containing clock-in and clock-out entries as
in the example below. The date is a simple date. The time format is
HH:MM[:SS][+-ZZZZ]. Seconds and timezone are optional. The timezone, if
present, must be four digits and is ignored (currently the time is
always interpreted as a local time).


i 2015/03/30 09:00:00 some:account name  optional description after two spaces
o 2015/03/30 09:20:00
i 2015/03/31 22:21:45 another account
o 2015/04/01 02:00:34

   hledger treats each clock-in/clock-out pair as a transaction posting
some number of hours to an account. Or if the session spans more than
one day, it is split into several transactions, one for each day. For
the above time log, `hledger print' generates these journal entries:


$ hledger -f t.timeclock print
2015/03/30 * optional description after two spaces
    (some:account name)         0.33h

2015/03/31 * 22:21-23:59
    (another account)         1.64h

2015/04/01 * 00:00-02:00
    (another account)         2.01h

   Here is a sample.timeclock to download and some queries to try:


$ hledger -f sample.timeclock balance                               # current time balances
$ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p 2009/3                    # sessions in march 2009
$ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p weekly --depth 1 --empty  # time summary by week

   To generate time logs, ie to clock in and clock out, you could:

   * use emacs and the built-in timeclock.el, or the extended
     timeclock-x.el and perhaps the extras in ledgerutils.el

   * at the command line, use these bash aliases:


     alias ti="echo i `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` \$* >>$TIMELOG"
     alias to="echo o `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` >>$TIMELOG"

   * or use the old `ti' and `to' scripts in the ledger 2.x repository.
     These rely on a "timeclock" executable which I think is just the
     ledger 2 executable renamed.
