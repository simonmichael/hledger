hledger is a command-line accounting tool similar to John Wiegley’s ledger tool.

The first release has been published on Hackage, and has attracted some
interest. It can be used for generating simple balance and transaction
reports from a plain-text general ledger. A home page and mail list has
also been created.

Immediate plans are to add some more of the most useful features from c++
ledger, so that hledger can be used for day-to-day finances, and to grow
the community of contributors.
