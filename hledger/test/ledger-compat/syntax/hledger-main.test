# * summary of main hledger journal syntax
# keep synced with hledger.m4.md

# Here is the main syntax of hledger's journal format
# (omitting extra Ledger compatibility syntax).
# hledger journals contain comments, directives, and transactions, in any order:

###############################################################################
# ** 1. Comment lines are for notes or temporarily disabling things.
# They begin with #, ;, or a line containing the word "comment".

# hash comment line
; semicolon comment line
comment
These lines
are commented.
end comment

# Some but not all hledger entries can have same-line comments attached to them,
# from ; (semicolon) to end of line.

###############################################################################
# ** 2. Directives modify parsing or reports in some way.
# They begin with a word or letter (or symbol).

account actifs     ; type:A, declare an account that is an Asset. 2+ spaces before ;.
account passifs    ; type:L, declare an account that is a Liability, and so on.. (ALERX)

payee Whole Foods
P 2022-01-01 AAAA $1.40
~ monthly    budget goals  ; <- 2+ spaces between period expression and description
    expenses:food       $400
    expenses:home      $1000
    budgeted

###############################################################################
# ** 3. Transactions are what it's all about; they are dated events,
# usually describing movements of money.
# They begin with a date.

# DATE DESCRIPTION           ; This is a transaction comment.
#   ACCOUNT NAME 1  AMOUNT1  ; <- posting 1. This is a posting comment.
#   ACCOUNT NAME 2  AMOUNT2  ; <- posting 2. Postings must be indented.
#               ; ^^ At least 2 spaces between account and amount.
#   ...  ; Any number of postings is allowed. The amounts must balance (sum to 0).

2022-01-01 opening balances are declared this way
    assets:checking          $1000  ; Account names can be anything. lower case is easy to type.
    assets:savings           $1000  ; assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses are common.
    assets:cash:wallet        $100  ; : indicates subaccounts.
    liabilities:credit card  $-200  ; liabilities, equity, revenues balances are usually negative.
    equity                          ; One amount can be left blank; $-1900 is inferred here.

2022-04-15 * (#12345) pay taxes
    ; There can be a ! or * after the date meaning "pending" or "cleared".
    ; There can be a transaction code (text in parentheses) after the date/status.
    ; Amounts' sign represents direction of flow, or credit/debit:
    assets:checking          $-500  ; minus means removed from this account (credit)
    expenses:tax:us:2021      $500  ; plus  means added to this account (debit)
                                    ; revenue/expense categories are also "accounts"

2022-01-01 Whole Foods | payee name and description can be separated by a pipe char  ; tag1:
    ; Transaction or posting comments can contain searchable tags,
    ; written NAME: or NAME:VALUE (value ends at comma or end of line).
    ; There's tag1 above with an empty value, and here's tag2:with a five word value
    expenses:food              $50
    assets:checking           $-50
     ; A few tags have special meaning.
     ; A "date" tag on a posting adjusts its date. (Doesn't affect the transaction date).
     ; date:2022-01-03, the checking posting cleared two days later.

2022-01-01                          ; The description is optional.
    ; Any currency/commodity symbols are allowed, on either side.

    assets:bag                   2 "Liquorice Wands"  ; must be double-quoted.

2022-01-01 Cost in another commodity can be noted with @ or @@
    assets:investments           2.0 AAAA @ $1.50  ; @  means per-unit cost
    assets:investments           3.0 AAAA @@ $4    ; @@ means total cost
    assets:checking            $-7.00

2022-01-02 assert balances
    ; Balances can be asserted for extra error checking, in any transaction.
    assets:investments           0 AAAA = 5.0 AAAA
    assets:pouch                 0 gold = 10 gold
    assets:savings              $0      = $1000
