A regression is "something that used to work, that broke", or "an unintended not-good change"
in a released version of hledger.

We don't like regressions. We want to detect them quickly, repair them quickly, and reduce their frequency.
You can help by finding them, or fixing them! 

## Regression finder bounty

We offer a $50 bounty for newly reported regression bugs (arising any time in the past, still affecting latest master).
([original announcement](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1570))

## Regression fixer bounty

We offer a separate $50 bounty for regression bug fixes landed in master.
(If you caused the regression, there's no bounty, though we do appreciate you reporting or fixing it.)

## Is there a time limit ?
Yes - once the bounty is confirmed, please claim it within 7 days.
If not, it will be automatically converted to a project donation at that time.
This reduces wasteful admin work.

## Should I claim the bounty ?
If you don't want the bounty, you can choose to donate it back to the project treasury,
by saying so or simply by not claiming it within the time limit.
But consider claiming - it's good for the project in several ways.

## How to claim the bounty

1. Discover a new regression and report it in the [hledger bug tracker](http://bugs.hledger.org).
   And/or, fix an open issue which has the `regression` label.
2. Wait for confirmation from the issue manager ([SM](https://joyful.com)).
3. Send an expense reimbursement request to [hledger's open collective](https://opencollective.com/hledger).
   Note this might reveal your real name.
   Here's the procedure:
   - at hledger's open collective, click [Submit Expense](https://opencollective.com/hledger/expenses/new).  (If you are logged in, this will be under the ACTIONS menu.)
   - choose **Invoice**; choose a Payout method; click Next
   - Expense title: **Regression (finder / fixer / finder & fixer) bounty for #NNNN**
   - Description: **(Found / Fixed) ISSUEURL, WORKDATE(S)**
   - Date: **today's date** (you may need to click and select it to make it work)
   - Amount: **USD 50** (or **100** if you found and fixed).
     Or convert to another currency with today's rate (and mention that rate in Description).
   - Next, Submit Expense
5. Wait for the finance manager (SM) to get the email notification and approve it. This should not take more than a day or two.
   (For fastest response, mention on the issue page or in chat that you've submitted.)
6. Wait for Open Collective to pay it. This should happen within a week (payouts happen twice a week).
