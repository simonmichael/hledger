.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hledger is a cross\-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
other commodity, using double\-entry accounting and a simple, editable
file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1).
.PP
hledger\-web is hledger\[aq]s web interface.
It starts a simple web application for browsing and adding transactions,
and optionally opens it in a web browser window if possible.
It provides a more user\-friendly UI than the hledger CLI or hledger\-ui
interface, showing more at once (accounts, the current account register,
balance charts) and allowing history\-aware data entry, interactive
searching, and bookmarking.
.PP
hledger\-web also lets you share a ledger with multiple users, or even
the public web.
There is no access control, so if you need that you should put it behind
a suitable web proxy.
As a small protection against data loss when running an unprotected
instance, it writes a numbered backup of the main journal file (only ?)
on every edit.
.PP
Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]\-f\f[], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
For more about this see hledger(1), hledger_journal(5) etc.
.PP
By default, hledger\-web starts the web app in "transient mode" and also
opens it in your default web browser if possible.
In this mode the web app will keep running for as long as you have it
open in a browser window, and will exit after two minutes of inactivity
(no requests and no browser windows viewing it).
With \f[C]\-\-serve\f[], it just runs the web app without exiting, and
logs requests to the console.
.PP
By default the server listens on IP address 127.0.0.1, accessible only
to local requests.
You can use \f[C]\-\-host\f[] to change this, eg
\f[C]\-\-host\ 0.0.0.0\f[] to listen on all configured addresses.
.PP
Similarly, use \f[C]\-\-port\f[] to set a TCP port other than 5000, eg
if you are running multiple hledger\-web instances.
.PP
You can use \f[C]\-\-base\-url\f[] to change the protocol, hostname,
port and path that appear in hyperlinks, useful eg for integrating
hledger\-web within a larger website.
The default is \f[C]http://HOST:PORT/\f[] using the server\[aq]s
configured host address and TCP port (or \f[C]http://HOST\f[] if PORT is
80).
.PP
With \f[C]\-\-file\-url\f[] you can set a different base url for static
files, eg for better caching or cookie\-less serving on high performance
websites.
.PP
Note there is no built\-in access control (aside from listening on
127.0.0.1 by default).
So you will need to hide hledger\-web behind an authenticating proxy
(such as apache or nginx) if you want to restrict who can see and add
entries to your journal.
.PP
Command\-line options and arguments may be used to set an initial filter
on the data.
This is not shown in the web UI, but it will be applied in addition to
any search query entered there.
.PP
With journal and timeclock files (but not CSV files, currently) the web
app detects changes made by other means and will show the new data on
the next request.
If a change makes the file unparseable, hledger\-web will show an error
until the file has been fixed.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Note: if invoking hledger\-web as a hledger subcommand, write
\f[C]\-\-\f[] before options as shown above.
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-serve\f[]
serve and log requests, don\[aq]t browse or auto\-exit
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-host=IPADDR\f[]
listen on this IP address (default: 127.0.0.1)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-port=PORT\f[]
listen on this TCP port (default: 5000)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-base\-url=URL\f[]
set the base url (default: http://IPADDR:PORT).
You would change this when sharing over the network, or integrating
within a larger website.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-file\-url=URL\f[]
set the static files url (default: BASEURL/static).
hledger\-web normally serves static files itself, but if you wanted to
serve them from another server for efficiency, you would set the url
with this.

The need to precede options with \f[C]\-\-\f[] when invoked from hledger
is awkward.
.PP
\f[C]\-f\-\f[] doesn\[aq]t work (hledger\-web can\[aq]t read from
stdin).
.PP
Query arguments and some hledger options are ignored.
.PP
Does not work in text\-mode browsers.
