payees

List the payee/payer names used or declared in the journal.

Flags:
     --used                 list payees used
     --declared             list payees declared
     --undeclared           list payees used but not declared
     --unused               list payees declared but not used

This command lists unique payee/payer names - all of them by default, or
just the ones which have been used in transaction descriptions, or
declared with payee directives, or used but not declared, or declared
but not used.

The payee/payer name is the part of the transaction description before a
| character (or if there is no |, the whole description).

You can add query arguments to select a subset of transactions or
payees.

Example:

$ hledger payees
Store Name
Gas Station
Person A
