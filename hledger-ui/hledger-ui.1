.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual is for hledger\[aq]s terminal interface, version 1.50.99.
See also the hledger manual for common concepts and file formats.
.PP
hledger is a robust, user\-friendly, cross\-platform set of programs for
tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double\-entry
accounting and a simple, editable file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1), and
largely interconvertible with beancount(1).
.PP
hledger\-ui is hledger\[aq]s terminal interface, providing an efficient
full\-window text UI for viewing accounts and transactions, and some
limited data entry capability.
It is easier than hledger\[aq]s command\-line interface, and sometimes
quicker and more convenient than the web interface.
.PP
Like hledger, it reads from (and appends to) a journal file specified by
the \f[CR]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] environment variable (defaulting to
\f[CR]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R]); or you can specify files with
\f[CR]\-f\f[R] options.
It can also read timeclock files, timedot files, or any CSV/SSV/TSV file
with a date field.
(See hledger(1) \-> Input for details.)
.PP
Unlike hledger, hledger\-ui hides all future\-dated transactions by
default.
They can be revealed, along with any rule\-generated periodic
transactions, by pressing the F key (or starting with \-\-forecast) to
enable \[dq]forecast mode\[dq].
.SH OPTIONS
Any arguments are interpreted as a hledger query which filters the data.
hledger\-ui provides the following options:
.IP
.EX
Flags:
  \-w \-\-watch                watch for data and date changes and reload
                            automatically
     \-\-theme=THEME          use this custom display theme (light,
                            greenterm, terminal, dark)
     \-\-cash                 start in the cash accounts screen
     \-\-bs                   start in the balance sheet accounts screen
     \-\-is                   start in the income statement accounts screen
     \-\-all                  start in the all accounts screen
     \-\-register=ACCTREGEX   start in the (first matched) account\[aq]s register
     \-\-change               show period balances (changes) at startup instead
                            of historical balances
  \-l \-\-flat                 show accounts as a flat list (default)
  \-t \-\-tree                 show accounts as a tree
.EE
.PP
and also supports many of hledger\[aq]s general options:
.IP
.EX
General input/data transformation flags:
  \-f \-\-file=[FMT:]FILE      Read data from FILE, or from stdin if FILE is \-,
                            inferring format from extension or a FMT: prefix.
                            Can be specified more than once. If not specified,
                            reads from $LEDGER_FILE or $HOME/.hledger.journal.
     \-\-rules=RULESFILE      Use rules defined in this rules file for
                            converting subsequent CSV/SSV/TSV files. If not
                            specified, uses FILE.csv.rules for each FILE.csv.
     \-\-alias=A=B|/RGX/=RPL  transform account names from A to B, or by
                            replacing regular expression matches
     \-\-auto                 generate extra postings by applying auto posting
                            rules (\[dq]=\[dq]) to all transactions
     \-\-forecast[=PERIOD]    Generate extra transactions from periodic rules
                            (\[dq]\[ti]\[dq]), from after the latest ordinary transaction
                            until 6 months from now. Or, during the specified
                            PERIOD (the equals is required). Auto posting rules
                            will also be applied to these transactions. In
                            hledger\-ui, also make future\-dated transactions
                            visible at startup.
  \-I \-\-ignore\-assertions    don\[aq]t check balance assertions by default
     \-\-txn\-balancing=...    how to check that transactions are balanced:
                            \[aq]old\[aq]:   use global display precision
                            \[aq]exact\[aq]: use transaction precision (default)
     \-\-infer\-costs          infer conversion equity postings from costs
     \-\-infer\-equity         infer costs from conversion equity postings
     \-\-infer\-market\-prices  infer market prices from costs
     \-\-pivot=TAGNAME        use a different field or tag as account names
  \-s \-\-strict               do extra error checks (and override \-I)
     \-\-verbose\-tags         add tags indicating generated/modified data

General output/reporting flags (supported by some commands):
  \-b \-\-begin=DATE           include postings/transactions on/after this date
  \-e \-\-end=DATE             include postings/transactions before this date
                            (with a report interval, will be adjusted to
                            following subperiod end)
  \-D \-\-daily                multiperiod report with 1 day interval
  \-W \-\-weekly               multiperiod report with 1 week interval
  \-M \-\-monthly              multiperiod report with 1 month interval
  \-Q \-\-quarterly            multiperiod report with 1 quarter interval
  \-Y \-\-yearly               multiperiod report with 1 year interval
  \-p \-\-period=PERIODEXP     set begin date, end date, and/or report interval,
                            with more flexibility
     \-\-today=DATE           override today\[aq]s date (affects relative dates)
     \-\-date2                match/use secondary dates instead (deprecated)
  \-U \-\-unmarked             include only unmarked postings/transactions
  \-P \-\-pending              include only pending postings/transactions
  \-C \-\-cleared              include only cleared postings/transactions
                            (\-U/\-P/\-C can be combined)
  \-R \-\-real                 include only non\-virtual postings
  \-E \-\-empty                Show zero items, which are normally hidden.
                            In hledger\-ui & hledger\-web, do the opposite.
     \-\-depth=DEPTHEXP       if a number (or \-NUM): show only top NUM levels
                            of accounts. If REGEXP=NUM, only apply limiting to
                            accounts matching the regular expression.
  \-B \-\-cost                 show amounts converted to their cost/sale amount
  \-V \-\-market               Show amounts converted to their value at period
                            end(s) in their default valuation commodity.
                            Equivalent to \-\-value=end.
  \-X \-\-exchange=COMM        Show amounts converted to their value at period
                            end(s) in the specified commodity.
                            Equivalent to \-\-value=end,COMM.
     \-\-value=WHEN[,COMM]    show amounts converted to their value on the
                            specified date(s) in their default valuation
                            commodity or a specified commodity. WHEN can be:
                            \[aq]then\[aq]:     value on transaction dates
                            \[aq]end\[aq]:      value at period end(s)
                            \[aq]now\[aq]:      value today
                            YYYY\-MM\-DD: value on given date
  \-c \-\-commodity\-style=S    Override a commodity\[aq]s display style.
                            Eg: \-c \[aq].\[aq] or \-c \[aq]1.000,00 EUR\[aq]
     \-\-pretty[=YN]          Use box\-drawing characters in text output? Can be
                            \[aq]y\[aq]/\[aq]yes\[aq] or \[aq]n\[aq]/\[aq]no\[aq].
                            If YN is specified, the equals is required.

General help flags:
  \-h \-\-help                 show command line help
     \-\-tldr                 show command examples with tldr
     \-\-info                 show the manual with info
     \-\-man                  show the manual with man
     \-\-version              show version information
     \-\-debug=[1\-9]          show this much debug output (default: 1)
     \-\-pager=YN             use a pager when needed ? y/yes (default) or n/no
     \-\-color=YNA \-\-colour   use ANSI color ? y/yes, n/no, or auto (default)
.EE
.PP
With hledger\-ui, the \f[CR]\-\-debug\f[R] option sends debug output to
a \f[CR]hledger\-ui.log\f[R] file in the current directory.
.PP
If you use the bash shell, you can auto\-complete flags by pressing TAB
in the command line.
If this is not working see Install > Shell completions.
.SH MOUSE
In most modern terminals, you can navigate through the screens with a
mouse or touchpad:
.IP \[bu] 2
Use mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll up and down
.IP \[bu] 2
Click on list items to go deeper
.IP \[bu] 2
Click on the left margin (column 0) to go back.
.SH KEYS
Keyboard gives more control.
.PP
\f[CR]?\f[R] shows a help dialog listing all keys.
(Some of these also appear in the quick help at the bottom of each
screen.)
Press \f[CR]?\f[R] again (or \f[CR]ESCAPE\f[R], or \f[CR]LEFT\f[R], or
\f[CR]q\f[R]) to close it.
The following keys work on most screens:
.PP
The cursor keys navigate: \f[CR]RIGHT\f[R] or \f[CR]ENTER\f[R] goes
deeper, \f[CR]LEFT\f[R] returns to the previous screen,
\f[CR]UP\f[R]/\f[CR]DOWN\f[R]/\f[CR]PGUP\f[R]/\f[CR]PGDN\f[R]/\f[CR]HOME\f[R]/\f[CR]END\f[R]
move up and down through lists.
Emacs\-style
(\f[CR]CTRL\-p\f[R]/\f[CR]CTRL\-n\f[R]/\f[CR]CTRL\-f\f[R]/\f[CR]CTRL\-b\f[R])
and VI\-style (\f[CR]k\f[R],\f[CR]j\f[R],\f[CR]l\f[R],\f[CR]h\f[R])
movement keys are also supported.
.PP
(Tip: movement speed is limited by your keyboard repeat rate, to move
faster you may want to adjust it.
On a mac, the Karabiner app is one way to do that.)
.PP
\f[CR]/\f[R] lets you set a general filter query limiting the data
shown, using the same query terms as in hledger and hledger\-web.
While editing the query, you can use CTRL\-a/e/d/k, BS, cursor keys;
press \f[CR]ENTER\f[R] to set it, or \f[CR]ESCAPE\f[R]to cancel.
There are also keys for quickly adjusting some common filters like
account depth and transaction status (see below).
\f[CR]BACKSPACE\f[R] or \f[CR]DELETE\f[R] removes all filters, showing
all transactions.
.PP
As mentioned above, by default hledger\-ui hides future transactions \-
both ordinary transactions recorded in the journal, and periodic
transactions generated by rule.
\f[CR]F\f[R] toggles forecast mode, in which future/forecasted
transactions are shown.
.PP
Pressing \f[CR]SHIFT\-DOWN\f[R] narrows the report period, and pressing
\f[CR]SHIFT\-UP\f[R] expands it again.
When narrowed, the current report period is displayed in the header
line, pressing \f[CR]SHIFT\-LEFT\f[R] or \f[CR]SHIFT\-RIGHT\f[R] moves
to the previous or next period, and pressing \f[CR]T\f[R] sets the
period to \[dq]today\[dq].
If you are using \f[CR]\-w/\-\-watch\f[R] and viewing a narrowed period
containing today, the view will follow any changes in system date
(moving to the period containing the new date).
(These keys work only with the standard Julian calendar
year/quarter/month/week/day periods; they are not affected by a custom
report interval specified at the command line.)
.PP
You can also specify a non\-standard period with \f[CR]/\f[R] and a
\f[CR]date:\f[R] query; in this case, the period is not movable with the
arrow keys.
.PP
(Tip: arrow keys with Shift do not work out of the box in all terminal
software.
Eg in Apple\[aq]s Terminal, the SHIFT\-DOWN and SHIFT\-UP keys must be
configured as follows: in Terminal\[aq]s preferences, click Profiles,
select your current profile on the left, click Keyboard on the right,
click + and add this for SHIFT\-DOWN: \f[CR]\[rs]033[1;2B\f[R], click +
and add this for SHIFT\-UP: \f[CR]\[rs]033[1;2A\f[R].
\ In other terminals (Windows Terminal ?)
you might need to configure SHIFT\-RIGHT and SHIFT\-LEFT to emit
\f[CR]\[rs]033[1;2C\f[R] and \f[CR]\[rs]033[1;2D\f[R] respectively.)
.PP
\f[CR]ESCAPE\f[R] resets the UI state and jumps back to the top screen,
restoring the app\[aq]s initial state at startup.
Or, it cancels minibuffer data entry or the help dialog.
.PP
\f[CR]CTRL\-l\f[R] redraws the screen and centers the selection if
possible (selections near the top won\[aq]t be centered, since we
don\[aq]t scroll above the top).
.PP
\f[CR]g\f[R] reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current
screen and any previous screens.
(With large files, this could cause a noticeable pause.)
.PP
\f[CR]I\f[R] toggles balance assertion checking.
Disabling balance assertions temporarily can be useful for
troubleshooting.
(If hledger\-ui was started with a \f[CR]\-\-pivot\f[R] option,
re\-enabling balance assertions with the \f[CR]I\f[R] key also reloads
the journal, like \f[CR]g\f[R].)
.PP
\f[CR]a\f[R] runs command\-line hledger\[aq]s add command, and reloads
the updated file.
This allows some basic data entry.
.PP
\f[CR]A\f[R] is like \f[CR]a\f[R], but runs the hledger\-iadd tool,
which provides a terminal interface.
This key will be available if \f[CR]hledger\-iadd\f[R] is installed in
$path.
.PP
\f[CR]E\f[R] runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR, or $EDITOR, or a default
(\f[CR]emacsclient \-a \[dq]\[dq] \-nw\f[R]) on the journal file.
With some editors (emacs, vi), the cursor will be positioned at the
current transaction when invoked from the register and transaction
screens, and at the error location (if possible) when invoked from the
error screen.
.PP
\f[CR]B\f[R] toggles cost mode, showing amounts converted to their
cost\[aq]s commodity (see hledger manual > Cost reporting.
.PP
\f[CR]V\f[R] toggles value mode, showing amounts converted to their
market value (see hledger manual > Valuation flag).
More specifically,
.IP "1." 3
By default, the \f[CR]V\f[R] key toggles showing end value
(\f[CR]\-\-value=end\f[R]) on or off.
The valuation date will be the report end date if specified, otherwise
today.
.IP "2." 3
If you started hledger\-ui with some other valuation (such as
\f[CR]\-\-value=then,EUR\f[R]), the \f[CR]V\f[R] key toggles that off or
on.
.PP
Cost/value tips: \- When showing end value, you can change the report
end date without restarting, by pressing \f[CR]/\f[R] and adding a query
like \f[CR]date:..YYYY\-MM\-DD\f[R].
\- Either cost mode, or value mode, can be active, but not both at once.
Cost mode takes precedence.
\- There\[aq]s not yet any visual indicator that cost or value mode is
active, other than the amount values.
.PP
\f[CR]q\f[R] quits the application.
.PP
Additional screen\-specific keys are described below.
.SH SCREENS
At startup, hledger\-ui shows a menu screen by default.
From here you can navigate to other screens using the cursor keys:
\f[CR]UP\f[R]/\f[CR]DOWN\f[R] to select, \f[CR]RIGHT\f[R] to move to the
selected screen, \f[CR]LEFT\f[R] to return to the previous screen.
Or you can use \f[CR]ESC\f[R] to return directly to the top menu screen.
.PP
You can also use a command line flag to specific a different startup
screen (\f[CR]\-\-cs\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-bs\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-is\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\-all\f[R], or \f[CR]\-\-register=ACCT\f[R]).
.SS Menu screen
This is the top\-most screen.
From here you can navigate to several screens listing accounts of
various types.
Note some of these may not show anything until you have configured
account types.
.SS Cash accounts screen
This screen shows \[dq]cash\[dq] (ie, liquid asset) accounts (like
\f[CR]hledger balancesheet type:c\f[R]).
It always shows balances (historical ending balances on the date shown
in the title line).
.SS Balance sheet accounts screen
This screen shows asset, liability and equity accounts (like
\f[CR]hledger balancesheetequity\f[R]).
It always shows balances.
.SS Income statement accounts screen
This screen shows revenue and expense accounts (like
\f[CR]hledger incomestatement\f[R]).
It always shows changes (balance changes in the period shown in the
title line).
.SS All accounts screen
This screen shows all accounts in your journal (unless filtered by a
query; like \f[CR]hledger balance\f[R]).
It shows balances by default; you can toggle showing changes with the
\f[CR]H\f[R] key.
.SS Register screen
This screen shows the transactions affecting a particular account.
Each line represents one transaction, and shows:
.IP \[bu] 2
the other account(s) involved, in abbreviated form.
(If there are both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts
affected by real postings.)
.IP \[bu] 2
the overall change to the current account\[aq]s balance; positive for an
inflow to this account, negative for an outflow.
.IP \[bu] 2
the running total after the transaction.
With the \f[CR]H\f[R] key you can toggle between
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
the period total, which is from just the transactions displayed
.IP \[bu] 2
or the historical total, which includes any undisplayed transactions
before the start of the report period (and matching the filter query if
any).
This will be the running historical balance (what you would see on a
bank\[aq]s website, eg) if not disturbed by a query.
.RE
.PP
Note, this screen combines each transaction\[aq]s in\-period postings to
a single line item, dated with the earliest in\-period transaction or
posting date (like hledger\[aq]s \f[CR]aregister\f[R]).
So custom posting dates can cause the running balance to be temporarily
inaccurate.
(See hledger manual > aregister and posting dates.)
.PP
Transactions affecting this account\[aq]s subaccounts will be included
in the register if the accounts screen is in tree mode, or if it\[aq]s
in list mode but this account has subaccounts which are not shown due to
a depth limit.
In other words, the register always shows the transactions contributing
to the balance shown on the accounts screen.
Tree mode/list mode can be toggled with \f[CR]t\f[R] here also.
.PP
\f[CR]U\f[R] toggles filtering by unmarked status, showing or hiding
unmarked transactions.
Similarly, \f[CR]P\f[R] toggles pending transactions, and \f[CR]C\f[R]
toggles cleared transactions.
(By default, transactions with all statuses are shown; if you activate
one or two status filters, only those transactions are shown; and if you
activate all three, the filter is removed.)
.PP
\f[CR]R\f[R] toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.
.PP
\f[CR]z\f[R] toggles nonzero mode, in which only transactions posting a
nonzero change are shown (hledger\-ui shows zero items by default,
unlike command\-line hledger).
.PP
Press \f[CR]RIGHT\f[R] to view the selected transaction in detail.
.SS Transaction screen
This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger\[aq]s print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).
.PP
The transaction\[aq]s date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).
.PP
\f[CR]UP\f[R] and \f[CR]DOWN\f[R] will step through all transactions
listed in the previous account register screen.
In the title bar, the numbers in parentheses show your position within
that account register.
They will vary depending on which account register you came from
(remember most transactions appear in multiple account registers).
The #N number preceding them is the transaction\[aq]s position within
the complete unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least
until the next reload).
.PP
On this screen (and the register screen), the \f[CR]E\f[R] key will open
your text editor with the cursor positioned at the current transaction
if possible.
.SS Error screen
This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload.
Once you have fixed the problem, press g again to reload and resume
normal operation.
(Or, you can press escape to cancel the reload attempt.)
.SH WATCH MODE
One of hledger\-ui\[aq]s best features is the auto\-reloading
\f[CR]\-w/\-\-watch\f[R] mode.
With this flag, it will update the display automatically whenever
changes are saved to the data files.
.PP
This is very useful when reconciling.
A good workflow is to have your bank\[aq]s online register open in a
browser window, for reference; the journal file open in an editor
window; and hledger\-ui in watch mode in a terminal window, eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger\-ui \-\-watch \-\-register checking \-C
.EE
.PP
As you mark things cleared in the editor, you can see the effect
immediately without having to context switch.
This leaves more mental bandwidth for your accounting.
Of course you can still interact with hledger\-ui when needed, eg to
toggle cleared mode, or to explore the history.
.SS \-\-watch problems
\f[I]However.\f[R] There are limitations/unresolved bugs with
\f[CR]\-\-watch\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
It may not work at all for you, depending on platform or system
configuration.
On some unix systems, increasing fs.inotify.max_user_watches or
fs.file\-max parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf might help.
(#836)
.IP \[bu] 2
It may not detect changes made from outside a virtual machine, ie by an
editor running on the host system.
.IP \[bu] 2
It may not detect file changes on certain less common filesystems.
.IP \[bu] 2
It may use increasing CPU and RAM over time, especially with large
files.
(This is probably not \-\-watch specific, you may be able to reproduce
it by pressing \f[CR]g\f[R] repeatedly.)
(#1825)
