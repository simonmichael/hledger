# 1.42.2 2025-05-16

Docs

- relnotes: fix links to hackage changelogs


# 1.42.1 2025-03-12

Infrastructure/Misc

- Tools updates

- Fix cabalfilestest: test all cabal files before any hackage upload.


# 1.42 2025-03-07

Infrastructure/Misc

- Unix bindists in github releases now include the man pages and info manuals. [#2309]

- Unix bindists in github releases are now normal .tar.gz files, without the extra zip compression. [#2299]

- Release notes and install instructions in github releases are now collapsed by default again.
  This makes the sequence of dates and releases clearer.
  Github automatically expands the assets of the latest release, so those will be visible by default.
  For a full text search of all release notes, use the https://hledger.org/relnotes.html page.

- hledger-install: if installing third party packages fails, it now tries again with bounds relaxed.
  This makes hledger-iadd and hledger-interest more likely to install successfully,
  even if their bounds have not yet been updated for a new hledger release.

- just functest now fails if there are warnings.
  (It does not force recompilation of already compiled modules,
  but even so this should help catch more warnings before pushing them to CI.)

  bench*.sh,
  changelogs-catchup,

[#2159]: https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2159

# 1.32.2 2023-12-31

Docs

- Added: 

- Updated: ISSUES.md, REGRESSIONS.md

- WORKFLOWS.md is renamed to DEVWORKFLOWS.md to avoid a name clash.

Examples

- New CSV rules examples for Wise, ING, Venmo, PayPal, FHB, N26, Triodos (Ilja Kocken) 

Scripts/addons

Infrastructure

- Project scripts in `Makefile` and `bake` have been converted to a `Justfile`.
  After many years using `make` and shell for scripting, I find `just`
  better enough, and the goal of clean consolidated efficient project
  automation so valuable, that we will use it in the hledger project
  even though it usually is not installed by default.

- The `.mailmap` file has been updated to clean up committer info in git output.

- `tools/generatejournal` can now be run as a script.

- The "new issue" and "new PR" templates have had some cleanup.

- There are some new issue tracker labels intended for use with a new 
  ISSUES.md > Prioritising scheme, and a few issues using them.

# 1.32 2023-12-01

Scripts/addons

- hledger-install.sh: replaced hledger-stockquotes with pricehist

- added gsheet-csv.hs: fetch a google sheet as CSV

- added hledger-report1: an example custom compound report, with haskell and bash versions

- justfile: updated import, time report scripts


Examples

- New:

  - Fidelity CSV rules

- Updated:

  - roi-unrealised.ledger (Charlie Ambrose)

Docs

- New:

  - Started a weekly This Week In Hledger news post, inspired by Matrix.
  - There's now a News page, for This Week In Hledger etc.
  - hledgermatic, an up-to-date, simple journal-first workflow
  - How to record journal entries: added
  - Reporting version control stats: added
  - Moved regression bounty info from the issue tracker to Developer docs > REGRESSIONS.

- Updated:

  - Checking for errors
  - Common workflows
  - Ledger
  - Simon's old setup
  - Videos
  - All docs now use the `cli` class instead of `shell` for command-line examples,
    avoiding inaccurate highlighting.


Infrastructure

- hledger.org website:

  - Fixed the webhook that was not updating the site on git push.
  
  - Fixed a problem with cloudflare authentication that was preventing
    automatic TLS certificate renewal on hledger.org.
  
  - Updated and committed hledger.org's caddy config and short urls (redirects)
  
  - Enabled https for code.hledger.org and site.hledger.org short urls.

  - Updated the stars.hledger.org redirect
    (we have reached the top 30 github-starred Haskell projects 🌟 🎉).
  
  - Set up a self-hosted Sandstorm server, and a public hledger-web
    instance (sandbox.hledger.org) in it that is fully writable (until
    spammers find it). Use it as a pastebin for examples, eg.

- Github CI (continuous integration) workflows have been optimised somewhat:

  - Scheduled weekly builds have been disabled, as they were propagating
    to forks and running wastefully there in some cases.

  - Some repeated rebuilding of the hledger-lib and hledger packages
    that seems unnecessary has been stopped.

  - hledger-ui no longer builds its modules twice.

  - Haddock testing now done only at release time.
  
  - renamed main CI workflow and branch to "ci"

- Tools:

  - .ghci: added an :rmain alias, which is like :main but reloads first -
  saves typing, and is useful eg when changing --debug level.

  - make haddock-watch is now fast


Finance

- Updated project finance scripts, regenerated the journal with consistent precisions.
  
- Updated reports with the last few months of data from Open Collective.


# 1.31 2023-09-03

Scripts/addons

- ft, tt shell scripts for collecting financial and time reports

- A justfile implementation of ft and tt

Examples

- self-tracking

- RPG ledger (Eric Mertens)

Docs

Infrastructure

- tools, CI: checkembeddedfiles, checkversions

- Shake: avoid making empty commits

- make functest-PAT: runs a subset of functional tests

- Provide a ghc-tags.yaml file to make use of ghc-tags with Hledger easy.

  ghc-tags is a standalone tool to replace the formerly-built-in
  ":ctags" feature (and I presume ":etags") in GHCi. These walked over
  the source and produced a TAGS file (in vim-compatible ctags or
  Emacs-compatible etags format) that allows the relevant editors to
  quickly navigate around function definitions.

  ghc-tags trips over some of the CPP used in Hledger. The solution
  is to provide ghc-tags with explicit CPP defines via a YAML file.
  However, if a YAML file is provided, one also must specify the source
  paths, as the tool XORs config file | paths-on-command-line.

  See <https://github.com/arybczak/ghc-tags/issues/6> for more
  information.
  (Jonathan Dowland)

- Many cleanups and improvements to the CI test and binary-generating
  github actions.  The CI tests for master now also include
  hledger-lib's doctests.

- make ghci-unit-test loads hledger-lib unit tests in GHCI.

# 1.26 2022-06-04

Scripts/addons

- renamed hledger-number.sh to hledger-simplebal

- added hledger-git, hledger-pijul

- fin (and bin) scripts show available scripts and their help

- renamed aliases.sh to bashrc

- Get hledger-print-location working. (Stephen Morgan)

Docs

- README cleanup, inspired by feedback from README reviewer Lars Wirzenius.

- Clearer sponsoring info and more complete sponsor lists on website and README.

- The new <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger_finance> repo
  keeps track of our public finances (on Open Collective, Liberapay etc.)

Examples

- invoice: calculate dates accurately on last days of month

Process

- Stackage nightly and GHC 9.2 are now the default for dev builds.

- CI workflows: 

  - Workflows and binaries have more consistent naming, mentioning platform and architecture.
  - The main test workflow is now `linux-x64-test`, replacing `push` and `pull`.
    It runs for both pushes and pull requests, and generates binaries on every run.
  - Pushes/merges to master, including Simon's, are required to have passed
    `linux-x64-test` on another github branch first.
  - Mac and Windows binaries are now stripped also (if applicable).

- `make buildtimes`, `make buildtimes-cabal` show GHC codegen times.

# 1.25 2022-03-04

Scripts/addons

- hledger-install.sh now also installs Pavan Rikhi's hledger-stockquotes tool.

- The bin/hledger-number addon was added.

- The bin/hledger-check-fancyassertions addon now shows docs in --help.

- A new invoice-making script was added: examples/invoicing/invoice-script/invoice

Process/tools

- The RELEASING doc and release process has been updated, 
  and a new helper script added: tools/releaseprep.
  `make hackageupload` now only works from a branch named
  VERSION-branch or VERSION-release. Ie, making releases from master
  is no longer allowed, a release branch is always required,

- CI: The commitlint check is more robust, and now runs only in
  the push to master and pull request workflows, and not eg when 
  building release binaries. linux-x64 binaries are now built
  with ghc 9.0, not 8.10. Workflow, branch, and binary names
  have been improved.

- `make ghci-ui`/`make ghcid-ui` now use older ghc 8.10 to avoid 
  ghc 9.0-triggered failures.

- hls support: The hie.yaml added to help hls work on mac m1 
  has been moved out of the way, since it probably makes things worse
  on other architectures.

# 1.24.1 2021-12-10

Docs

- More platform notes for setting LEDGER_FILE.

- Clarify which commands support which output formats and data layouts.

- Note that hyphenated field names are allowed in CSV rules.

- Fix some table layouts in non-HTML docs.

# 1.24 2021-12-01

Software

- bin/hledger-check-fancyassertions.hs: fix ugly assertion parse errors. 
  (ShrykeWindgrace)

- bin/hledger-check-tagfiles.hs: Update description, clarify wording.
  (Pranesh Prakash)

Docs

- Account types: prioritise the short one-letter names, hide the deprecated
  legacy syntax.

- Directives: a more compact and accurate overview.

- examples/templates/basic: A new starter file set, and a place to collect them.

- Expose more developer docs as separate web pages:
  CHANGELOGS, COMMITS, RELEASING, etc.

- Fix a link to developer workflows. (Joaquin "Florius" Azcarate)

Process

- PR template: Fix our github PR template to use proper comment syntax,
  and link to more relevant docs.
  (toonn)

- cabal.project: Drop obsolete compatibility comment. 
  (#1365, toonn)

- Bump default stackage snapshot to one avoiding buggy happy version.

- bin/changelog: a new helper making changelog edits more pleasant.

- make throughput{,-dev,-EXE}: reports transactions per second for a range of
  file sizes with the hledger in PATH, hledger dev build, or named hledger 
  executable.

- make install-as-FOO: build executables and save as bin/hledger*-FOO

- perf: bench-ledger.sh for comparative benchmarking with Ledger.

- CI: commitlint: be more forgiving when we can't figure out recent commits
  (don't check any).

- CI: commitlint: recognise any commit starting with ‘Merge’ as a merge commit
  (and ignore it). (Stephen Morgan)


# 1.23 2021-09-21

Software:

- The bin/hledger-check-fancyassertions.hs addon script,
  allowing more complex balance assertions, works again.
  (#1464, Stephen Morgan)

- Many code cleanups suggested by hlint (Stephen Morgan)

Docs:

- Added a public BACKLOG.org to the hledger repo and website.

- Website updates:

  - Reorganised site content.
  - Improved page tables of contents.
  - Content fixes.
  - New docs:
    Currency conversion.
    hledger and Beancount/GnuCash/Ledger/Quicken.

- New examples: systemd and nginx configs for hledger-web (Alan Young)

Tools/process:

- `make site-watch` works again

- `make list-commits` and `make showauthors` show those things.

- `Shake cabalfiles` now uses (and requires) hpack in $PATH, to avoid building.
  It should be the version that's in the current stack release, to avoid commit conflicts.

- shake: changelogs: A leading semicolon now means 
  "skip most CI steps", not "omit from changelog".

- ci: most steps are skipped if commit message begins with ;.

- hledger developers now use GHC 9.0/stackage nightly by default. (#1503)

- Our doctests are disabled with GHC 9 for now to work around an
  upstream bug. 
  ([#1503](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1503), 
  [#1615](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1615))

- bin/commitlint is a new tool for hledger developers which checks and
  describes new commit conventions which simplify maintenance of
  change docs and releasing. It can be run locally while developing,
  manually or as a pre-commit hook
  (`ln -sf ../../bin/commitling .git/hooks/commit-msg`), 
  and is also run by our CI workflows to check pull requests.
  <https://hledger.org/CONTRIBUTING.html#commit-messages>,
  <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/bin/commitlint>
  (#1602)

# 1.22 2021-07-03

Software:

- We now provide static executables for GNU/Linux on x64 (amd64) and arm32v7
  architectures. These are more portable and more likely to work on your linux
  system than the dynamic Ubuntu executables we have been providing.
  These will also be useful for Nextcloud.com users. (#1571) (Garret McGraw)

- GHC 9.0 is now officially supported, and GHC 8.0, 8.2, 8.4 are not;
  building hledger now requires GHC 8.6 or greater.

Docs:

- The info manuals now have the proper metadata so you or your
  packager can install them with `install-info` and they will appear
  in info's Directory. We also provide a `dir` file making it easy
  for developers to see the latest dev manuals in their info Directory.
  (#1585) (Damien Cassou, Simon Michael)

Chat:

- The hledger IRC channels (#hledger:libera.chat,
  #hledger-bots:libera.chat) moved to Libera.chat.
    
- The hledger Matrix room (#hledger:matrix.org), is now on at least
  equal "official" footing with the IRC channel. 
  
- I upgraded the matrix room to a newer version of the Matrix
  protocol. This effectively splits it into an old (read only) room
  and a new room. If you are joined to the old room, you might not
  have noticed; in your matrix client, please follow the link to the
  new room, ie #hledger:matrix.org.

- I briefly bridged the IRC and matrix rooms, because having two chats
  (four if we consider #plaintextaccounting) is a pain. I hope to try
  the experiment again at some point.

# 1.21 2021-03-10

- roi has a new cookbook doc, and example files have been updated.
  (Dmitry Astapov)

- Example CSV rules for the Daedalus wallet have been added.

- The default stackage resolver/GHC version has been bumped to
  lts-17.4/ghc-8.10.4.

- tools/generatejournal now includes more commodities and prices in
  generated journals. (Stephen Morgan)

- Our functional tests now also run on BSD. (#1434, Felix Van der Jeugt)

- Addon scripts in bin/ have been updated for latest hledger API (Stephen Morgan).

- Addon scripts are now compiled as part of our CI tests, and always
  with the same version of hledger source they were shipped with. We
  now require script users to check out the hledger source tree and
  run the scripts (or, `bin/compile.sh`) from there. This keeps users
  and tests in sync, making things more reliable for everyone. (#1453)

- Last but not least, hledger's bash completions (provided in ./shell-completions/)
  have been thoroughly updated (#1404, #1410, Vladimir Zhelezov).

  "This was supposed to be just a fix for #1404 but upon visiting the source
   several issues became apparent and that is why the commit grew a bit more than
   expected. A complete list of changes below:
  
  - Fix #1404.
    No more orphaned temporary directories. Commands, options, etc. that used to be
    stored in there are included at build-time as here documents in the source.
  
  - Fix artifacts in /tmp after build.
    Upon fixing the above I became aware that the build itself was leaving behind a
    heap of artifacts in /tmp that were not taken care of with a make clean.
    Fixed by using temporary files and directories in the build directory. Makefile
    and build scripts adjusted.
  
  - Produce command aliases.
    Regular expressions in build scripts changed to produce all command aliases
    except single letter ones (see below)
  
  - Do not propose single letters completions.
    It is simply not useful and adds a lot of noise. It makes completion slower as
    well because you need to hit yes on the prompt:
    Display all 200 possibilities? (y or n)
    output-options.sh now excludes those.
  
  - Query filters simplified.
    Keep only the prefix of the filter with the colon in query-filters.txt. This
    change has two reasons:
  
  - Single letter completions are not useful (see above).
    It allows for completion suggestions specific to each
    Bonus reason: it's a completion engine, not a user manual.
    Fix completion impacts on global environment
    The completion script was making a couple of changes to the global environment
    which had an impact for the rest of the shell session.
  
  - set -o pipefail: the change is hidden from the user and could lead to subtle
    errors throughout the shell session.
    COMP_WORDBREAKS=" ": this affects subsequent completions for us and other
    programs too. I exclude the colon : from its value and use
    compopt -o filenames to handle escaping of special characters for us. I would
    like to find a solution without messing with COMP_WORDBREAKS but it is not
    straight forward.

  - Fix hiding of legit subcommands.
    Completion was hiding all possibilities if a subcommand happens to be the prefix
    of another. On typing balance, one should be proposed balancesheet and
    balancesheetequity as well.
  
  - Return early.
    Try to complete depending on the current context and return immediately if
    successful. Keep completion list relevant and as short as possible.
  
  - Context aware completion
  
    Add handlers for option parameter completion, see _hledger_compreply_optarg()
    Add handlers for query filters:, see _hledger_compreply_query()
    Use --file and --rules-file arguments when proposing completions for the
    above, see _hledger()
    Propose only top level accounts at first. Again, keep it short and focused.
    Custom compgen wrapper
    compgen is fairly complicated. There is no way to feed it a word list with
    literals. It will mangle your input in so many ways that we cannot trust it. To
    work around this several wrappers are used: _hledger_compgen() works with
    _hledger_quote_by_ref() to process and escape newline separated input which is
    then fed to compgen and finally in COMPREPLY through _hledger_compreply()
    and _hledger_compreply_append(). It sounds messy and I guess it is, I would like
    to find a more straight forward way to do it. I think it is still a way better
    and safer interface with readline than trying to grep our way through.
  
  - Replace declare with local.
    Again, this script is sourced by the shell -- keep variable scopes as narrow as
    possible. Oops, they are actually synonymous when used in a function but
    local declares our intentions explicitly.
  
  - Use compopt -o nosort.
    Often I resort to using it to keep different groups of completions together.
    Whether this is more ergonomic or not is subjective. But our input lists are
    already sorted at build-time so why not. Sort manually query-filters.txt when
    editing it.
  
  - Remove irrelevant comments.
    And add some new ones :)
  
  I think that is all. Give it a spin, try to abuse it, in and outside of quotes,
  with some funky accounts, payees, tags, whatever, and tell me where it breaks or
  behaves unexpectedly."

# 1.20.4 2021-01-29

# 1.20.3 2021-01-14

- The run/compile instructions for add-on scripts in bin/ have been
  updated. The scripts now use `stack runghc` and are tested (manually
  with `make functest` for now) with the corresponding hledger source,
  not the hledger on stackage.

# 1.20 2020-12-05

- examples: clean up & add more budgeting examples

- examples: stripe csv

- The functional tests in tests/ have been moved into the respective
  packages, eg hledger/test/ and hledger-ui/test/.

- Shake cabalfiles: now gives an error when it fails

- make bench: add some large tabular reports; 
  run just the slowest commands by default;
  run after make (func)test

- a hie.yaml file has been added, so hledger source loads
  easily in IDEs supporting haskell-language-server

# 2020-09-07

- Update shell completions (Jakob Schöttl)

# 1.19 2020-09-01

- example scripts:

  - stack scripts now use stack's script command consistently
  - stack scripts no longer have explicit --package lists, stack
    infers them from the imports
  - hledger-print-location: new script

- CI: 

  - always recompile all modules for robustness
  - generate optimised binaries, which can be downloaded
  - build a single different GHC version with each workflow, reducing
    total building and carbon footprint a bit
  - stop building with GHC 8.0

- the default stack file now uses lts 16.12 (ghc 8.8.4)

# 1.18.1 2020-06-21

- provide CI binaries for windows, mac & gnu/linux

# 1.18 2020-06-07

- new example scripts:

  - hledger-combine-balances.hs, hledger-balance-as-budget.hs  (Dmitry Astapov)
  - hledger-check-tag-files.hs, hledger-check-tag-files2.hs

- more CSV rule examples: coinbase, waveapp

- new CI (continuous integration) system using Github Actions.
  Thanks to Travis and Appveyor for their service to date.
  Improvements:

  - one CI service instead of several
  - more closely integrated with code repo
  - tests run on the three main platforms (linux, mac, windows)
  - harmless commits are ignored automatically ([ci skip] no longer needed for doc commits)
  - scheduled and on-demand testing (push to master, push to ci-* branches, pull request, weekly)
  - now tested: all GHC versions, doctests, haddock building
  - new shortcut url: http://ci.hledger.org

# 1.17 2020-03-01

- hledger-install: re-enable installation of hledger-iadd & hledger-interest.

- hledger-install: bump minimum stack version to 1.9.1
  1.7.1 fails with deps using newer cabal file syntax I believe.

- hledger-install: always do stack update, to help ensure we get the latest packages.
  https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5112

- examples: Add a basic example of rule parsing for the output of csb2format. (Evilham)
  csb2format deals with the CSB43/AEB43 format, which all banks operating in
  Spain must support.
  Having these example rules enables easens bootstraping for users with a
  Spanish bank account.

- doc: simpler, clearer structure in the manuals and hledger.org sidebar

- doc: a new [Quick Start](https://hledger.org/start.html) page

- doc: a new [Common Tasks](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#common-tasks) section in the hledger manual

- doc: a new invoicing how-to: https://hledger.org/invoicing.html

- doc: Fix dead pointer in contributing (Aleksandar Dimitrov)

- doc: Fix build badges for Travis and AppVeyor (Rui Chen)

# 1.16 2019-12-01

- add support for GHC 8.8, base-compat 0.11 (#1090)

- drop support for GHC 7.10

- add descriptions to most issue tracker labels

- matrix.hledger.org now redirects to a more readable/useful url

# 1.15 2019-09-01

- install: bump to lts-14.4, hledger 1.15, drop hledger-api

- bump versions to 1.15

- api: drop from Shake scripts

- new unified website: hledger.org now has its own git repo, has
  absorbed the github wiki, and is generated with Sphinx.

- hledger-api's functionality is now included in hledger-web,
  and the hledger-api package is mothballed.

- hledger-install.sh: updated, now also works on FreeBSD 12 (zieone)

- bin/ addon scripts: hledger-swap-dates added; hledger-check,
  hledger-smooth updated. (#1072)

- shell-completion/ scripts: updated (Jakob Schöttl)

- github: FUNDING.yml / sponsor button configured

- tools: generatejournal updates: vary amount, make reports with fewer
  zeroes, start from a fixed year to keep tests stable, also generate
  P records. (#999)

- tools: make, shake, CI: misc. updates

- doc: add a README for the functional tests, linked from contrib guide

- hledger-makeitso has been renamed to hledger-flow (Andreas Pauley)

- The hledger docker image is now based on the "haskell" image (Dmitry Astapov)


# 1.14 2019-03-01

- hledger.org website: now uses https, home page updates,
  download page improved package list with status badges.
  Also the github wiki pages are now rendered as part of hledger.org,
  like the main site pages (with pandoc markdown and tables of contents).
  Building the site now requires that a copy of the wiki is checked out
  under wiki/.

- bash completion support: removed duplicate options, added new
  options, stopped listing -h as a command, added some completion for
  external addon commands.

- release automation improvements

- makefile cleanups; make site-liverender helps with local site preview

# 1.13 (2019/01/02)

- packaging: A docker image providing the main hledger tools is now
  linked on the download page. This is another way to get up-to-date
  hledger tools without building them yourself (and, a way to run
  hledger-ui on windows ?) (Dmitry Astapov, Simon Michael)

- hledger-install.sh: fix installation of stack when .local/bin is not
  in PATH (Dmitry Astapov)

- doc: fixed pandoc typography conversion in web manuals. Eg `--` was
  being rendered as en-dash. (#954).

Developers:

- developer docs have moved from the wiki into CONTRIBUTING.md (#920)

- new streamlined changelog update process. Shake targets:
  
      ./Shake changelogs
      ./Shake CHANGES.md
      ./Shake CHANGES.md-dry
      ./Shake PKG/CHANGES.md
      ./Shake PKG/CHANGES.md-dry

  update the project-wide and/or package changelogs, inserting new
  commits (touching the respective directory, since the tag version or
  commit hash which is the first word in the changelog's previous top
  heading) at the top, formatted as changelog entries.

- ./Shake PKG - builds a package plus its embedded docs.
  ./Shake build - builds all the packages and their embedded docs.
  ("stack build PKG" does not notice changes in embedded doc files.)

- make ghci-shake - loads Shake.hs in ghci

- make tags - includes doc source files, hpack/cabal files, Shake.hs

- make site-livereload - opens a reloading browser view on the website html
  (requires `livereloadx`)

- added a Dockerfile and helper scripts (Dmitry Astapov)
  
- doc files and hpack/cabal files are included in TAGS again
