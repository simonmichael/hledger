## prices

Print the [market prices](hledger.md#p-directive) declared with P directives.
With --infer-market-prices, also show any additional prices inferred from [costs](hledger.md#costs).
With --show-reverse, also show additional prices inferred by reversing known prices.

```flags
Flags:
     --show-reverse         also show the prices inferred by reversing known
                            prices
     --summary              summarise declared prices per commodity instead
                            of listing them
     --locations            also show where prices where declared
```

With `--locations`, each price line gets a trailing
`; location: FILE:LINE` comment showing where it came from.
Declared prices point at their P directive; prices inferred from
[costs](hledger.md#costs) point at the parent transaction's first line.
Reversed prices keep the source position of the directive they were
derived from.

Price amounts are always displayed with their full precision,
except for reverse prices which are limited to 8 decimal digits.

Prices can be filtered by a date:, cur: or amt: query.

Generally if you run this command with --infer-market-prices --show-reverse,
it will show the same prices used internally to calculate value reports.
But if in doubt, you can inspect those directly by running the value report
with --debug=2.

### prices summary

With `--summary`, instead of listing individual prices, `prices` prints
one row per commodity used in the journal (other than the [base
currency](#getprices)), with the following columns:

- **Commodity** — the commodity, as an ISO 4217 code if possible.
- **Prices** — the number of market price declarations for that commodity.
- **Earliest** / **Latest** — the date range of those prices.
- **Period** — the duration between earliest and latest.
- **Coverage** — the percentage of weekdays in that period
  that have a price declared (or blank when fewer than two prices).

Summary mode is a quick way to spot gaps in your price data, and pairs
naturally with [getprices](#getprices). Only prices declared with P directives
are counted; prices inferred with `--show-reverse` or `--infer-market-prices` are ignored.

Queries (`cur:`, `date:`, `amt:`) can be used to narrow the prices that are summarised.
