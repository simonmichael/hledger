hledger-web(1) hledger-web 1.3.1
********************************

hledger-web is hledger's web interface.  It starts a simple web
application for browsing and adding transactions, and optionally opens
it in a web browser window if possible.  It provides a more
user-friendly UI than the hledger CLI or hledger-ui interface, showing
more at once (accounts, the current account register, balance charts)
and allowing history-aware data entry, interactive searching, and
bookmarking.

   hledger-web also lets you share a ledger with multiple users, or even
the public web.  There is no access control, so if you need that you
should put it behind a suitable web proxy.  As a small protection
against data loss when running an unprotected instance, it writes a
numbered backup of the main journal file (only ?)  on every edit.

   Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger
journal, timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or
'$LEDGER_FILE', or '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  For more about this see hledger(1),
hledger_journal(5) etc.

   By default, hledger-web starts the web app in "transient mode" and
also opens it in your default web browser if possible.  In this mode the
web app will keep running for as long as you have it open in a browser
window, and will exit after two minutes of inactivity (no requests and
no browser windows viewing it).  With '--serve', it just runs the web
app without exiting, and logs requests to the console.

   By default the server listens on IP address 127.0.0.1, accessible
only to local requests.  You can use '--host' to change this, eg '--host
0.0.0.0' to listen on all configured addresses.

   Similarly, use '--port' to set a TCP port other than 5000, eg if you
are running multiple hledger-web instances.

   You can use '--base-url' to change the protocol, hostname, port and
path that appear in hyperlinks, useful eg for integrating hledger-web
within a larger website.  The default is 'http://HOST:PORT/' using the
server's configured host address and TCP port (or 'http://HOST' if PORT
is 80).

   With '--file-url' you can set a different base url for static files,
eg for better caching or cookie-less serving on high performance
websites.

   Note there is no built-in access control (aside from listening on
127.0.0.1 by default).  So you will need to hide hledger-web behind an
authenticating proxy (such as apache or nginx) if you want to restrict
who can see and add entries to your journal.

   Command-line options and arguments may be used to set an initial
filter on the data.  This is not shown in the web UI, but it will be
applied in addition to any search query entered there.

   With journal and timeclock files (but not CSV files, currently) the
web app detects changes made by other means and will show the new data
on the next request.  If a change makes the file unparseable,
hledger-web will show an error until the file has been fixed.

1 OPTIONS
*********

Note: if invoking hledger-web as a hledger subcommand, write '--' before
options as shown above.

'--serve'

     serve and log requests, don't browse or auto-exit
'--host=IPADDR'

     listen on this IP address (default: 127.0.0.1)
'--port=PORT'

     listen on this TCP port (default: 5000)
'--base-url=URL'

     set the base url (default: http://IPADDR:PORT). You would change
     this when sharing over the network, or integrating within a larger
     website.
'--file-url=URL'

     set the static files url (default: BASEURL/static).  hledger-web
     normally serves static files itself, but if you wanted to serve
     them from another server for efficiency, you would set the url with
     this.

   hledger input options:

'-f FILE --file=FILE'

     use a different input file.  For stdin, use - (default:
     '$LEDGER_FILE' or '$HOME/.hledger.journal')
'--rules-file=RULESFILE'

     Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)
'--alias=OLD=NEW'

     rename accounts named OLD to NEW
'--anon'

     anonymize accounts and payees
'--pivot TAGNAME'

     use some other field/tag for account names
'-I --ignore-assertions'

     ignore any failing balance assertions

   hledger reporting options:

'-b --begin=DATE'

     include postings/txns on or after this date
'-e --end=DATE'

     include postings/txns before this date
'-D --daily'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by day
'-W --weekly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by week
'-M --monthly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by month
'-Q --quarterly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by quarter
'-Y --yearly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by year
'-p --period=PERIODEXP'

     set start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
     (overrides the flags above)
'--date2'

     show, and match with -b/-e/-p/date:, secondary dates instead
'-U --unmarked'

     include only unmarked postings/txns (can combine with -P or -C)
'-P --pending'

     include only pending postings/txns
'-C --cleared'

     include only cleared postings/txns
'-R --real'

     include only non-virtual postings
'--depth=N'

     hide accounts/postings deeper than N
'-E --empty'

     show items with zero amount, normally hidden
'-B --cost'

     convert amounts to their cost at transaction time (using the
     transaction price, if any)
'-V --value'

     convert amounts to their market value on the report end date (using
     the most recent applicable market price, if any)

   hledger help options:

'-h'

     show general usage (or after COMMAND, command usage)
'--help'

     show this program's manual as plain text (or after an add-on
     COMMAND, the add-on's manual)
'--man'

     show this program's manual with man
