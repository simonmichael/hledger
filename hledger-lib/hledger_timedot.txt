NAME
       Timedot - hledger's human-friendly time logging format

DESCRIPTION
       Timedot  is  a plain text format for logging dated, categorised quanti-
       ties (of time, usually), supported by hledger.  It  is  convenient  for
       approximate  and  retroactive  time  logging,  eg  when  the  real-time
       clock-in/out required with a timeclock  file  is  too  precise  or  too
       interruptive.   It can be formatted like a bar chart, making clear at a
       glance where time was spent.

       Though called "timedot", this format is read by hledger  as  commodity-
       less  quantities,  so  it  could  be used to represent dated quantities
       other than time.  In the docs below we'll assume it's time.

FILE FORMAT
       A timedot file contains a series of day entries.  A  day  entry  begins
       with  a date, and is followed by category/quantity pairs, one per line.
       Dates are hledger-style simple dates (see  hledger_journal(5)).   Cate-
       gories  are  hledger-style account names, optionally indented.  As in a
       hledger journal, there must be at least two spaces between the category
       (account name) and the quantity.

       Quantities can be written as:

       o a  sequence  of  dots  (.)  representing  quarter  hours.  Spaces may
         optionally be used for grouping and readability.  Eg: ....  ..

       o an integral or decimal number, representing hours.  Eg: 1.5

       o an integral or decimal number immediately followed by a  unit  symbol
         s,  m,  h, d, w, mo, or y, representing seconds, minutes, hours, days
         weeks, months or years respectively.  Eg: 90m.  The following equiva-
         lencies  are  assumed,  currently: 1m = 60s, 1h = 60m, 1d = 24h, 1w =
         7d, 1mo = 30d, 1y=365d.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with #, ; or * are ignored.   An  exam-
       ple:

              # on this day, 6h was spent on client work, 1.5h on haskell FOSS work, etc.

              inc:client1   .... ....
              biz:research  .

       Or with numbers:

              2016/2/3
              inc:client1   4
              fos:hledger   3
              biz:research  1

       Reporting:

              $ hledger -f t.timedot print date:2016/2/2
              2016/02/02 *

                  (biz:research)          0.25

              $ hledger -f t.timedot bal --daily --tree
              Balance changes in 2016/02/01-2016/02/03:

       I  prefer to use period for separating account components.  We can make
       this work with an account alias:

              2016/2/4
              fos.hledger.timedot  4
              fos.ledger           ..

              $ hledger -f t.timedot --alias /\\./=: bal date:2016/2/4
                              4.50  fos
                              4.00    hledger:timedot
                              0.50    ledger
              --------------------
                              4.50

       Here is a sample.timedot.
