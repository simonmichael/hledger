NAME
       CSV - how hledger reads CSV data, and the CSV rules file format

DESCRIPTION
       hledger  can read CSV (Comma Separated Value/Character Separated Value)
       files as if they were journal files, automatically converting each  CSV
       record  into  a transaction.  (To learn about writing CSV, see CSV out-
       put.)

       We describe each CSV file's format with a corresponding rules file.  By
       default  this is named like the CSV file with a .rules extension added.
       Eg when reading FILE.csv, hledger also looks for FILE.csv.rules in  the
       same  directory.   You  can  specify  a  different  rules file with the
       --rules-file option.  If a rules file is not found, hledger will create
       a sample rules file, which you'll need to adjust.

       This  file  contains rules describing the CSV data (header line, fields
       layout, date format etc.), and how to construct hledger journal entries
       (transactions) from it.  Often there will also be a list of conditional
       rules  for  categorising  transactions  based  on  their  descriptions.
       Here's an overview of the CSV rules; these are described more fully be-
       low, after the examples:

       skip               skip one  or  more  header
                          lines   or   matched   CSV
                          records
       fields             name  CSV  fields,  assign
                          them to hledger fields
       field assignment   assign   a  value  to  one
                          hledger field, with inter-
                          polation
       separator          a custom field separator
       if                 apply    some   rules   to
                          matched CSV records
       end                skip  the  remaining   CSV
                          records
       date-format        describe the format of CSV
                          dates
       newest-first       disambiguate record  order
                          when there's only one date
       include            inline  another  CSV rules
                          file

       Note, for best error messages when reading CSV files, use a .csv,  .tsv
       or .ssv file extension or file prefix - see File Extension below.

       There's an introductory Convert CSV files tutorial on hledger.org.

EXAMPLES
       Here  are  some sample hledger CSV rules files.  See also the full col-
       lection at:
       https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/examples/csv

   Basic
       At minimum, the rules file must identify the date  and  amount  fields,
       and  often  it also specifies the date format and how many header lines
       there are.  Here's a simple CSV file and a rules file for it:

              Date, Description, Id, Amount
              12/11/2019, Foo, 123, 10.23

              # basic.csv.rules
              skip         1
              fields       date, description, _, amount
              date-format  %d/%m/%Y

              $ hledger print -f basic.csv
              2019-11-12 Foo
                  expenses:unknown           10.23
                  income:unknown            -10.23

       Default account names are chosen, since we didn't set them.

   Bank of Ireland
       Here's a CSV with two amount fields (Debit and Credit), and  a  balance
       field,  which we can use to add balance assertions, which is not neces-
       sary but provides extra error checking:

              Date,Details,Debit,Credit,Balance
              07/12/2012,LODGMENT       529898,,10.0,131.21
              07/12/2012,PAYMENT,5,,126

              # bankofireland-checking.csv.rules

              # skip the header line
              skip

              # name the csv fields, and assign some of them as journal entry fields
              fields  date, description, amount-out, amount-in, balance

              # We generate balance assertions by assigning to "balance"
              # above, but you may sometimes need to remove these because:
              #
              # - the CSV balance differs from the true balance,
              #   by up to 0.0000000000005 in my experience
              #
              # - it is sometimes calculated based on non-chronological ordering,
              #   eg when multiple transactions clear on the same day

              # date is in UK/Ireland format
              date-format  %d/%m/%Y

              # set the currency
              currency  EUR

              # set the base account for all txns
              account1  assets:bank:boi:checking

              $ hledger -f bankofireland-checking.csv print
              2012-12-07 LODGMENT       529898
                  assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR10.0 = EUR131.2
                  income:unknown                  EUR-10.0

              2012-12-07 PAYMENT
                  assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR-5.0 = EUR126.0
                  expenses:unknown                  EUR5.0

       The balance assertions don't raise an error above, because we're  read-
       ing  directly  from  CSV, but they will be checked if these entries are
       imported into a journal file.

   Amazon
       Here we convert amazon.com order history, and use an if block to gener-
       ate  a third posting if there's a fee.  (In practice you'd probably get
       this data from your bank instead, but it's an example.)

CSV RULES
       The following kinds of rule can appear in the rules file, in any order.
       Blank lines and lines beginning with # or ; are ignored.

   skip
              skip N

       The word "skip" followed by a number (or no number,  meaning  1)  tells
       hledger  to  ignore  this  many non-empty lines preceding the CSV data.
       (Empty/blank lines are skipped automatically.) You'll need  this  when-
       ever your CSV data contains header lines.

       It also has a second purpose: it can be used inside if blocks to ignore
       certain CSV records (described below).

   fields
              fields FIELDNAME1, FIELDNAME2, ...

       A fields list (the word  "fields"  followed  by  comma-separated  field
       names)  is  the quick way to assign CSV field values to hledger fields.
       It does two things:

       1. it names the CSV fields.  This is optional, but  can  be  convenient
          later for interpolating them.

       2. when you use a standard hledger field name, it assigns the CSV value
          to that part of the hledger transaction.

       Here's an example that says "use the 1st, 2nd and  4th  fields  as  the
       transaction's  date,  description  and amount; name the last two fields
       for later reference; and ignore the others":

              fields date, description, , amount, , , somefield, anotherfield

       Field names may not contain whitespace.  Fields you  don't  care  about
       can  be  left  unnamed.  Currently there must be least two items (there
       must be at least one comma).

       Note, always use comma in the fields list, even if your  CSV  uses  an-
       other separator character.

       Here are the standard hledger field/pseudo-field names.  For more about
       the transaction parts they refer to, see the manual for hledger's jour-
       nal format.

   Transaction field names
       date, date2, status, code, description, comment can be used to form the
       transaction's first line.

   Posting field names
       accountN, where N is 1 to 9, generates a  posting,  with  that  account
       name.   Most  often  there  are two postings, so you'll want to set ac-
       count1 and account2.  If a posting's account name is left unset but its
       amount is set, a default account name will be chosen (like expenses:un-
       known or income:unknown).

       amountN sets posting N's amount.  Or, amount with  no  N  sets  posting
       1's.   If  the  CSV  has  debits  and  credits  in separate fields, use
       amountN-in and amountN-out instead.  Or amount-in and  amount-out  with
       no N for posting 1.

       For  convenience  and backwards compatibility, if you set the amount of
       posting 1 only, a second posting with the negative amount will be  gen-
       erated  automatically.  (Unless the account name is parenthesised indi-
       cating an unbalanced posting.)

       If the CSV has the currency symbol in a separate  field,  you  can  use
       currencyN  to prepend it to posting N's amount.  currency with no N af-
       fects ALL postings.

       balanceN sets a balance assertion amount (or if the posting  amount  is
       left  empty,  a  balance assignment).  You may need to adjust this with
       the balance-type rule.

       Finally, commentN sets a comment on the Nth posting.  Comments can also
       contain tags, as usual.

       See TIPS below for more about setting amounts and currency.

   field assignment
              HLEDGERFIELDNAME FIELDVALUE

       Instead  of  or  in addition to a fields list, you can use a "field as-
       signment" rule to set the value of a single hledger field,  by  writing
       its  name (any of the standard hledger field names above) followed by a
       text value.  The value may contain interpolated CSV fields,  referenced
       by  their  1-based position in the CSV record (%N), or by the name they
       were given in the fields list (%CSVFIELDNAME).  Some examples:

              # set the amount to the 4th CSV field, with " USD" appended
              amount %4 USD

              # combine three fields to make a comment, containing note: and date: tags
              comment note: %somefield - %anotherfield, date: %1

       Interpolation strips outer whitespace (so a CSV value like "  1  "  be-
       comes 1 when interpolated) (#1051).  See TIPS below for more about ref-
       erencing other fields.

   separator
       You can use the separator directive to read other kinds  of  character-
       separated data.  Eg to read SSV (Semicolon Separated Values), use:

              separator ;

       The  separator directive accepts exactly one single byte character as a
       separator.  To specify whitespace characters, you may use  the  special
       words TAB or SPACE.  Eg to read TSV (Tab Separated Values), use:

              separator TAB

       See also: File Extension.

   if
              if MATCHER
               RULE

              if
              MATCHER
              MATCHER
              MATCHER
               RULE
               RULE

       Conditional  blocks ("if blocks") are a block of rules that are applied
       only to CSV records which match certain patterns.  They are often  used
       for customising account names based on transaction descriptions.

       Each MATCHER can be a record matcher, which looks like this:

              REGEX

       REGEX  is  a  case-insensitive  regular expression which tries to match
       anywhere within the CSV record.  It is a POSIX extended regular expres-
       sions  with some additions (see Regular expressions in the hledger man-
       ual).  Note: the "CSV record" it is matched against is not the original
       record, but a synthetic one, with enclosing double quotes or whitespace
       removed, and always comma-separated.  (Eg, an  SSV  record  2020-01-01;
       "Acme, Inc."; 1,000 appears to REGEX as 2020-01-01,Acme, Inc.,1,000).

       Or, MATCHER can be a field matcher, like this:

              %CSVFIELD REGEX

       which  matches just the content of a particular CSV field.  CSVFIELD is
       a percent sign followed by the field's  name  or  column  number,  like
       %date or %1.

       A single matcher can be written on the same line as the "if"; or multi-
       ple matchers can be written on the following lines, non-indented.  Mul-
       tiple matchers are OR'd (any one of them can match).

       After  the patterns there should be one or more rules to apply, all in-
       dented by at least one space.  Three kinds of rule are allowed in  con-
       ditional blocks:

       o field assignments (to set a hledger field)

       o skip (to skip the matched CSV record)

       o end (to skip all remaining CSV records).

       Examples:

              # if the CSV record contains "groceries", set account2 to "expenses:groceries"
              if groceries
               account2 expenses:groceries

              # if the CSV record contains any of these patterns, set account2 and comment as shown
              if
              monthly service fee
              atm transaction fee
              banking thru software
               account2 expenses:business:banking
               comment  XXX deductible ? check it

   end
       This  rule  can  be  used inside if blocks (only), to make hledger stop
       reading this CSV file and move on to the next input file, or to command
       execution.  Eg:

              # ignore everything following the first empty record
              if ,,,,
               end

   date-format
              date-format DATEFMT

       This  is  a  helper for the date (and date2) fields.  If your CSV dates
       are not formatted like YYYY-MM-DD,  YYYY/MM/DD  or  YYYY.MM.DD,  you'll
       need  to  add  a  date-format rule describing them with a strptime date
       parsing pattern, which must parse the CSV date value completely.   Some
       examples:

              # MM/DD/YY
              date-format %m/%d/%y

              # D/M/YYYY
              # The - makes leading zeros optional.
              date-format %-d/%-m/%Y

              # YYYY-Mmm-DD
              date-format %Y-%h-%d

              # M/D/YYYY HH:MM AM some other junk
              # Note the time and junk must be fully parsed, though only the date is used.
              date-format %-m/%-d/%Y %l:%M %p some other junk

       For the supported strptime syntax, see:
       https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time/docs/Data-Time-For-
       mat.html#v:formatTime

   newest-first
       hledger always sorts the generated transactions by date.   Transactions
       on  the same date should appear in the same order as their CSV records,
       as hledger can usually auto-detect whether the CSV's  normal  order  is
       oldest first or newest first.  But if all of the following are true:

       o the  CSV  might  sometimes  contain just one day of data (all records
         having the same date)

       o the CSV records are normally in reverse chronological  order  (newest
         at the top)

       o and you care about preserving the order of same-day transactions

       then, you should add the newest-first rule as a hint.  Eg:

              # tell hledger explicitly that the CSV is normally newest first
              newest-first

   include
              include RULESFILE

       This  includes  the  contents  of another CSV rules file at this point.
       RULESFILE is an absolute file path or a path relative  to  the  current
       file's  directory.  This can be useful for sharing common rules between
       several rules files, eg:

              # someaccount.csv.rules

              ## someaccount-specific rules
              fields   date,description,amount
              account1 assets:someaccount
              account2 expenses:misc

              ## common rules
              include categorisation.rules

   balance-type
       Balance assertions generated by assigning to balanceN are of the simple
       =  type  by  default, which is a single-commodity, subaccount-excluding
       assertion.  You may find the subaccount-including variants more useful,
       eg  if  you  have  created some virtual subaccounts of checking to help
       with budgeting.  You can select a different type of assertion with  the
       balance-type rule:

              # balance assertions will consider all commodities and all subaccounts
              balance-type ==*

       Here are the balance assertion types for quick reference:

              =    single commodity, exclude subaccounts
              =*   single commodity, include subaccounts
              ==   multi commodity,  exclude subaccounts
              ==*  multi commodity,  include subaccounts

TIPS
   Rapid feedback
       It's  a  good idea to get rapid feedback while creating/troubleshooting
       CSV rules.  Here's a good way, using entr from http://eradman.com/entr-
       project :

              $ ls foo.csv* | entr bash -c 'echo ----; hledger -f foo.csv print desc:SOMEDESC'

       A  desc:  query (eg) is used to select just one, or a few, transactions
       of interest.  "bash -c" is used to run multiple  commands,  so  we  can
       echo  a  separator  each  time the command re-runs, making it easier to
       read the output.

   Valid CSV
       hledger accepts CSV conforming to RFC 4180.  When CSV  values  are  en-
       closed in quotes, note:

       o they must be double quotes (not single quotes)

       o spaces outside the quotes are not allowed

   File Extension
       CSV  ("Character  Separated  Values") files should be named with one of
       these filename extensions: .csv, .ssv, .tsv.  Or, the file path  should
       be  prefixed with one of csv:, ssv:, tsv:.  This helps hledger identify
       the format and show the right error messages.  For example:

              $ hledger -f foo.ssv print

       or:

              $ cat foo | hledger -f ssv:- foo

       More about this: Input files in the hledger manual.

   Reading multiple CSV files
       If you use multiple -f options to read  multiple  CSV  files  at  once,
       hledger  will  look for a correspondingly-named rules file for each CSV
       file.  But if you use the --rules-file option, that rules file will  be
       used for all the CSV files.

   Valid transactions
       After reading a CSV file, hledger post-processes and validates the gen-
       erated journal entries as it would for a journal file - balancing them,
       applying  balance  assignments,  and canonicalising amount styles.  Any
       errors at this stage will be reported in the usual way, displaying  the
       problem entry.

       There is one exception: balance assertions, if you have generated them,
       will not be checked, since normally these will work only when  the  CSV
       data  is part of the main journal.  If you do need to check balance as-
       sertions generated from CSV right away, pipe into another hledger:

              $ hledger -f file.csv print | hledger -f- print

   Deduplicating, importing
       When you download a CSV file periodically, eg to get your  latest  bank
       transactions,  the  new  file  may overlap with the old one, containing
       some of the same records.

       The import command will (a) detect the new transactions, and (b) append
       just those transactions to your main journal.  It is idempotent, so you
       don't have to remember how many times you ran it or with which  version
       of  the  CSV.  (It keeps state in a hidden .latest.FILE.csv file.) This
       is the easiest way to import CSV data.  Eg:

              # download the latest CSV files, then run this command.
              # Note, no -f flags needed here.
              $ hledger import *.csv [--dry]

       This method works for most CSV files.  (Where  records  have  a  stable
       chronological order, and new records appear only at the new end.)

       A  number of other tools and workflows, hledger-specific and otherwise,
       exist for converting, deduplicating, classifying and managing CSV data.
       See:

       o https://hledger.org -> sidebar -> real world setups

       o https://plaintextaccounting.org -> data import/conversion

   Setting amounts
       A posting amount can be set in one of these ways:

       o by  assigning  (with  a  fields  list  or field assigment) to amountN
         (posting N's amount) or amount (posting 1's amount)

       o by assigning to amountN-in and amountN-out (or amount-in and  amount-
         out).   For  each CSV record, whichever of these has a non-zero value
         will be used, with appropriate sign.   If  both  contain  a  non-zero
         value, this may not work.

       o by  assigning  to balanceN (or balance) instead of the above, setting
         the amount indirectly via a balance assignment.  If you do  this  the
         default account name may be wrong, so you should set that explicitly.

       There is some special handling for an amount's sign:

       o If  an amount value is parenthesised, it will be de-parenthesised and
         sign-flipped.

       o If an amount value begins with a double minus sign, those cancel  out
         and are removed.

       o If an amount value begins with a plus sign, that will be removed

   Setting currency/commodity
       If  the  currency/commodity  symbol  is  included  in  the CSV's amount
       field(s), you don't have to do anything special.

       If the currency is provided as a separate CSV field, you can either:

       o assign that to currency, which adds it to all posting  amounts.   The
         symbol  will prepended to the amount quantity (on the left side).  If
         you write a trailing space after the symbol, there will  be  a  space
         between  symbol  and  amount  (an  exception  to the usual whitespace
         stripping).

       o or assign it to currencyN which adds it to posting N's amount only.

       o or for more control, construct the amount from  symbol  and  quantity
         using field assignment, eg:

                fields date,description,currency,quantity
                # add currency symbol on the right:
                amount %quantity %currency

   Referencing other fields
       In  field assignments, you can interpolate only CSV fields, not hledger
       fields.  In the example below, there's both a CSV field and  a  hledger
       field  named  amount1, but %amount1 always means the CSV field, not the
       hledger field:

              # Name the third CSV field "amount1"
              fields date,description,amount1

              # Set hledger's amount1 to the CSV amount1 field followed by USD
              amount1 %amount1 USD

              # Set comment to the CSV amount1 (not the amount1 assigned above)
              comment %amount1

       Here, since there's no CSV amount1 field, %amount1 will produce a  lit-
       eral "amount1":

              fields date,description,csvamount
              amount1 %csvamount USD
              # Can't interpolate amount1 here
              comment %amount1

       When  there  are  multiple field assignments to the same hledger field,
       only the last one takes effect.  Here, comment's value will be be B, or
       C if "something" is matched, but never A:

              comment A
              comment B
              if something
               comment C

   How CSV rules are evaluated
       Here's  how  to  think of CSV rules being evaluated (if you really need
       to).  First,

       o include - all includes are inlined, from top to bottom, depth  first.
         (At  each  include  point the file is inlined and scanned for further
         includes, recursively, before proceeding.)

       Then "global" rules are evaluated, top to bottom.  If  a  rule  is  re-
       peated, the last one wins:

       o skip (at top level)

       o date-format

       o newest-first

       o fields - names the CSV fields, optionally sets up initial assignments
         to hledger fields

       Then for each CSV record in turn:

       o test all if blocks.  If any of them contain a end rule, skip all  re-
         maining  CSV  records.  Otherwise if any of them contain a skip rule,
         skip that many CSV records.   If  there  are  multiple  matched  skip
         rules, the first one wins.

       o collect  all field assignments at top level and in matched if blocks.
         When there are multiple assignments for a field, keep only  the  last
         one.

       o compute  a value for each hledger field - either the one that was as-
         signed to it (and interpolate the %CSVFIELDNAME references), or a de-
         fault

       o generate a synthetic hledger transaction from these values.

       This  is all part of the CSV reader, one of several readers hledger can
       use to parse input files.  When all files have been read  successfully,
       the  transactions  are passed as input to whichever hledger command the
       user specified.
