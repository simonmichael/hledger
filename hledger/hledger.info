hledger(1) hledger 1.15.99
**************************

This is hledger's command-line interface (there are also terminal and
web interfaces).  Its basic function is to read a plain text file
describing financial transactions (in accounting terms, a general
journal) and print useful reports on standard output, or export them as
CSV. hledger can also read some other file formats such as CSV files,
translating them to journal format.  Additionally, hledger lists other
hledger-* executables found in the user's $PATH and can invoke them as
subcommands.

   hledger reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or
'$LEDGER_FILE', or '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  If using '$LEDGER_FILE', note this
must be a real environment variable, not a shell variable.  You can
specify standard input with '-f-'.

   Transactions are dated movements of money between two (or more) named
accounts, and are recorded with journal entries like this:

2015/10/16 bought food
 expenses:food          $10
 assets:cash

   For more about this format, see hledger_journal(5).

   Most users use a text editor to edit the journal, usually with an
editor mode such as ledger-mode for added convenience.  hledger's
interactive add command is another way to record new transactions.
hledger never changes existing transactions.

   To get started, you can either save some entries like the above in
'~/.hledger.journal', or run 'hledger add' and follow the prompts.  Then
try some commands like 'hledger print' or 'hledger balance'.  Run
'hledger' with no arguments for a list of commands.

2.2 Command options
===================

To see options for a particular command, including command-specific
options, run: 'hledger COMMAND -h'.

   Command-specific options must be written after the command name, eg:
'hledger print -x'.

   Additionally, if the command is an addon, you may need to put its
options after a double-hyphen, eg: 'hledger ui -- --watch'.  Or, you can
run the addon executable directly: 'hledger-ui --watch'.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Command arguments,  Next: Argument files,  Prev: Command options,  Up: OPTIONS

2.3 Command arguments
=====================

Most hledger commands accept arguments after the command name, which are
often a query, filtering the data in some way.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Argument files,  Next: Special characters in arguments and queries,  Prev: Command arguments,  Up: OPTIONS

2.4 Argument files
==================

You can save a set of command line options/arguments in a file, one per
line, and then reuse them by writing '@FILENAME' in a command line.  To
prevent this expansion of '@'-arguments, precede them with a '--'
argument.  For more, see Save frequently used options.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Special characters in arguments and queries,  Next: Command line tips,  Prev: Argument files,  Up: OPTIONS

2.5 Special characters in arguments and queries
===============================================

In shell command lines, option and argument values which contain
"problematic" characters, ie spaces, and also characters significant to
your shell such as '<', '>', '(', ')', '|' and '$', should be escaped by
enclosing them in quotes or by writing backslashes before the
characters.  Eg:

   'hledger register -p 'last year' "accounts receivable
(receivable|payable)" amt:\>100'.

File: hledger.info,  Node: More escaping,  Next: Even more escaping,  Up: Special characters in arguments and queries

2.5.1 More escaping
-------------------

Characters significant both to the shell and in regular expressions may
need one extra level of escaping.  These include parentheses, the pipe
symbol and the dollar sign.  Eg, to match the dollar symbol, bash users
should do:

   'hledger balance cur:'\$''

   or:

   'hledger balance cur:\\$'


File: hledger.info,  Node: Even more escaping,  Next: Less escaping,  Prev: More escaping,  Up: Special characters in arguments and queries

2.5.2 Even more escaping
------------------------

When hledger runs an addon executable (eg you type 'hledger ui', hledger
runs 'hledger-ui'), it de-escapes command-line options and arguments
once, so you might need to _triple_-escape.  Eg in bash, running the ui
command and matching the dollar sign, it's:

   'hledger ui cur:'\\$''

   or:

   'hledger ui cur:\\\\$'

   If you asked why _four_ slashes above, this may help:

unescaped:        '$'
escaped:          '\$'
double-escaped:   '\\$'
triple-escaped:   '\\\\$'

   (The number of backslashes in fish shell is left as an exercise for
the reader.)

   You can always avoid the extra escaping for addons by running the
addon directly:

   'hledger-ui cur:\\$'


File: hledger.info,  Node: Less escaping,  Prev: Even more escaping,  Up: Special characters in arguments and queries

2.5.3 Less escaping
-------------------

Inside an argument file, or in the search field of hledger-ui or
hledger-web, or at a GHCI prompt, you need one less level of escaping
than at the command line.  And backslashes may work better than quotes.
Eg:

   'ghci> :main balance cur:\$'


File: hledger.info,  Node: Command line tips,  Next: Unicode characters,  Prev: Special characters in arguments and queries,  Up: OPTIONS

2.6 Command line tips
=====================

If in doubt, keep things simple:

   * write options after the command ('hledger CMD -OPTIONS ARGS')
   * run add-on executables directly ('hledger-ui -OPTIONS ARGS')
   * enclose problematic args in single quotes
   * if needed, also add a backslash to escape regexp metacharacters

   To find out exactly how a command line is being parsed, add
'--debug=2' to troubleshoot.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Unicode characters,  Next: Input files,  Prev: Command line tips,  Up: OPTIONS

2.7 Unicode characters
======================

hledger is expected to handle non-ascii characters correctly:

   * they should be parsed correctly in input files and on the command
     line, by all hledger tools (add, iadd, hledger-web's
     search/add/edit forms, etc.)

   * they should be displayed correctly by all hledger tools, and
     on-screen alignment should be preserved.

   This requires a well-configured environment.  Here are some tips:

   * A system locale must be configured, and it must be one that can
     decode the characters being used.  In bash, you can set a locale
     like this: 'export LANG=en_US.UTF-8'.  There are some more details
     in Troubleshooting.  This step is essential - without it, hledger
     will quit on encountering a non-ascii character (as with all
     GHC-compiled programs).

   * your terminal software (eg Terminal.app, iTerm, CMD.exe, xterm..)
     must support unicode

   * the terminal must be using a font which includes the required
     unicode glyphs

   * the terminal should be configured to display wide characters as
     double width (for report alignment)

   * on Windows, for best results you should run hledger in the same
     kind of environment in which it was built.  Eg hledger built in the
     standard CMD.EXE environment (like the binaries on our download
     page) might show display problems when run in a cygwin or msys
     terminal, and vice versa.  (See eg #961).


File: hledger.info,  Node: Input files,  Next: Smart dates,  Prev: Unicode characters,  Up: OPTIONS

2.8 Input files
===============

hledger reads transactions from a data file (and the add command writes
to it).  By default this file is '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (or on
Windows, something like 'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  You can
override this with the '$LEDGER_FILE' environment variable:

$ setenv LEDGER_FILE ~/finance/2016.journal
$ hledger stats

   or with the '-f/--file' option:

$ hledger -f /some/file stats

   The file name '-' (hyphen) means standard input:

$ cat some.journal | hledger -f-

   Usually the data file is in hledger's journal format, but it can also
be one of several other formats, listed below.  hledger detects the
format automatically based on the file extension, or if that is not
recognised, by trying each built-in "reader" in turn:

Reader:  Reads:                           Used for file extensions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'journal'hledger's journal format, also   '.journal' '.j' '.hledger'
         some Ledger journals             '.ledger'
'timeclock'timeclock files (precise time  '.timeclock'
         logging)
'timedot'timedot files (approximate       '.timedot'
         time logging)
'csv'    comma-separated values (data     '.csv'
         interchange)

   If needed (eg to ensure correct error messages when a file has the
"wrong" extension), you can force a specific reader/format by prepending
it to the file path with a colon.  Examples:

$ hledger -f csv:/some/csv-file.dat stats
$ echo 'i 2009/13/1 08:00:00' | hledger print -ftimeclock:-

   You can also specify multiple '-f' options, to read multiple files as
one big journal.  There are some limitations with this:

   * directives in one file will not affect the other files
   * balance assertions will not see any account balances from previous
     files

   If you need those, either use the include directive, or concatenate
the files, eg: 'cat a.journal b.journal | hledger -f- CMD'.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Smart dates,  Next: Report start & end date,  Prev: Input files,  Up: OPTIONS

2.9 Smart dates
===============

hledger's user interfaces accept a flexible "smart date" syntax (unlike
dates in the journal file).  Smart dates allow some english words, can
be relative to today's date, and can have less-significant date parts
omitted (defaulting to 1).

   Examples:

'2004/10/1', '2004-01-01', '2004.9.1'   exact date, several separators allowed.  Year is 4+ digits, month is 1-12, day is 1-31
'2004'                                  start of year
'2004/10'                               start of month
'10/1'                                  month and day in current year
'21'                                    day in current month
'october, oct'                          start of month in current year
'yesterday, today, tomorrow'            -1, 0, 1 days from today
'last/this/next                         -1, 0, 1 periods from the current period
day/week/month/quarter/year'
'20181201'                              8 digit YYYYMMDD with valid year month and day
'201812'                                6 digit YYYYMM with valid year and month

   Counterexamples - malformed digit sequences might give surprising
results:

'201813'      6 digits with an invalid month is parsed as start of 6-digit year
'20181301'    8 digits with an invalid month is parsed as start of 8-digit year
'20181232'    8 digits with an invalid day gives an error
'201801012'   9+ digits beginning with a valid YYYYMMDD gives an error


File: hledger.info,  Node: Report start & end date,  Next: Report intervals,  Prev: Smart dates,  Up: OPTIONS

2.10 Report start & end date
============================

Most hledger reports show the full span of time represented by the
journal data, by default.  So, the effective report start and end dates
will be the earliest and latest transaction or posting dates found in
the journal.

   Often you will want to see a shorter time span, such as the current
month.  You can specify a start and/or end date using '-b/--begin',
'-e/--end', '-p/--period' or a 'date:' query (described below).  All of
these accept the smart date syntax.

   Some notes:

   * As in Ledger, end dates are exclusive, so you need to write the
     date _after_ the last day you want to include.
   * As noted in reporting options: among start/end dates specified with
     _options_, the last (i.e.  right-most) option takes precedence.
   * The effective report start and end dates are the intersection of
     the start/end dates from options and that from 'date:' queries.
     That is, 'date:2019-01 date:2019 -p'2000 to 2030'' yields January
     2019, the smallest common time span.

   Examples:

'-b 2016/3/17'      begin on St.  Patrick's day 2016
'-e 12/1'           end at the start of december 1st of the current year (11/30 will be the last date included)
'-b thismonth'      all transactions on or after the 1st of the current month
'-p thismonth'      all transactions in the current month
'date:2016/3/17-'   the above written as queries instead
'date:-12/1'
'date:thismonth-'
'date:thismonth'


File: hledger.info,  Node: Report intervals,  Next: Period expressions,  Prev: Report start & end date,  Up: OPTIONS

2.11 Report intervals
=====================

A report interval can be specified so that commands like register,
balance and activity will divide their reports into multiple subperiods.
The basic intervals can be selected with one of '-D/--daily',
'-W/--weekly', '-M/--monthly', '-Q/--quarterly', or '-Y/--yearly'.  More
complex intervals may be specified with a period expression.  Report
intervals can not be specified with a query.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Period expressions,  Next: Depth limiting,  Prev: Report intervals,  Up: OPTIONS

2.12 Period expressions
=======================

The '-p/--period' option accepts period expressions, a shorthand way of
expressing a start date, end date, and/or report interval all at once.

   Here's a basic period expression specifying the first quarter of
2009.  Note, hledger always treats start dates as inclusive and end
dates as exclusive:

   '-p "from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"'

   Keywords like "from" and "to" are optional, and so are the spaces, as
long as you don't run two dates together.  "to" can also be written as
"-".  These are equivalent to the above:

'-p "2009/1/1 2009/4/1"'
'-p2009/1/1to2009/4/1'
'-p2009/1/1-2009/4/1'

   Dates are smart dates, so if the current year is 2009, the above can
also be written as:

'-p "1/1 4/1"'
'-p "january-apr"'
'-p "this year to 4/1"'

   If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be
the earliest or latest transaction in your journal:

'-p "from 2009/1/1"'   everything after january 1, 2009
'-p "from 2009/1"'     the same
'-p "from 2009"'       the same
'-p "to 2009"'         everything before january 1, 2009

   A single date with no "from" or "to" defines both the start and end
date like so:

'-p "2009"'       the year 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2010/1/1"
'-p "2009/1"'     the month of jan; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/2/1"
'-p "2009/1/1"'   just that day; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/1/2"

   The argument of '-p' can also begin with, or be, a report interval
expression.  The basic report intervals are 'daily', 'weekly',
'monthly', 'quarterly', or 'yearly', which have the same effect as the
'-D','-W','-M','-Q', or '-Y' flags.  Between report interval and
start/end dates (if any), the word 'in' is optional.  Examples:

'-p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"'
'-p "monthly in 2008"'
'-p "quarterly"'

   Note that 'weekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly' and 'yearly' intervals
will always start on the first day on week, month, quarter or year
accordingly, and will end on the last day of same period, even if
associated period expression specifies different explicit start and end
date.

   For example:

'-p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"' - starts on 2008/12/29, closest preceeding Monday
'-p "monthly in 2008/11/25"' - starts on 2018/11/01
'-p "quarterly from 2009-05-05 to 2009-06-01"' - starts on 2009/04/01, ends on 2009/06/30, which are first and last days of Q2 2009
'-p "yearly from 2009-12-29"' - starts on 2009/01/01, first day of 2009

   The following more complex report intervals are also supported:
'biweekly', 'bimonthly', 'every day|week|month|quarter|year', 'every N
days|weeks|months|quarters|years'.

   All of these will start on the first day of the requested period and
end on the last one, as described above.

   Examples:

'-p "bimonthly from 2008"' - periods will have boundaries on 2008/01/01, 2008/03/01, ...
'-p "every 2 weeks"' - starts on closest preceeding Monday
'-p "every 5 month from 2009/03"' - periods will have boundaries on 2009/03/01, 2009/08/01, ...

   If you want intervals that start on arbitrary day of your choosing
and span a week, month or year, you need to use any of the following:

   'every Nth day of week', 'every <weekday>', 'every Nth day [of
month]', 'every Nth weekday [of month]', 'every MM/DD [of year]', 'every
Nth MMM [of year]', 'every MMM Nth [of year]'.

   Examples:

'-p "every 2nd day of week"' - periods will go from Tue to Tue
'-p "every Tue"' - same
'-p "every 15th day"' - period boundaries will be on 15th of each month
'-p "every 2nd Monday"' - period boundaries will be on second Monday of each month
'-p "every 11/05"' - yearly periods with boundaries on 5th of Nov
'-p "every 5th Nov"' - same
'-p "every Nov 5th"' - same

   Show historical balances at end of 15th each month (N is exclusive
end date):

   'hledger balance -H -p "every 16th day"'

   Group postings from start of wednesday to end of next tuesday (N is
start date and exclusive end date):

   'hledger register checking -p "every 3rd day of week"'

2.13 Depth limiting
===================

With the '--depth N' option (short form: '-N'), commands like account,
balance and register will show only the uppermost accounts in the
account tree, down to level N. Use this when you want a summary with
less detail.  This flag has the same effect as a 'depth:' query argument
(so '-2', '--depth=2' or 'depth:2' are basically equivalent).


File: hledger.info,  Node: Pivoting,  Next: Valuation,  Prev: Depth limiting,  Up: OPTIONS

2.14 Pivoting
=============

Normally hledger sums amounts, and organizes them in a hierarchy, based
on account name.  The '--pivot FIELD' option causes it to sum and
organize hierarchy based on the value of some other field instead.
FIELD can be: 'code', 'description', 'payee', 'note', or the full name
(case insensitive) of any tag.  As with account names, values containing
'colon:separated:parts' will be displayed hierarchically in reports.

   '--pivot' is a general option affecting all reports; you can think of
hledger transforming the journal before any other processing, replacing
every posting's account name with the value of the specified field on
that posting, inheriting it from the transaction or using a blank value
if it's not present.

   An example:

2016/02/16 Member Fee Payment
    assets:bank account                    2 EUR
    income:member fees                    -2 EUR  ; member: John Doe

   Normal balance report showing account names:

$ hledger balance
               2 EUR  assets:bank account
              -2 EUR  income:member fees
--------------------
                   0

   Pivoted balance report, using member: tag values instead:

$ hledger balance --pivot member
               2 EUR
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
                   0

   One way to show only amounts with a member: value (using a query,
described below):

$ hledger balance --pivot member tag:member=.
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
              -2 EUR

   Another way (the acct: query matches against the pivoted "account
name"):

$ hledger balance --pivot member acct:.
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
              -2 EUR

File: hledger.info,  Node: -B Cost,  Next: -V Market value,  Up: Valuation

2.15.1 -B: Cost
---------------

The '-B/--cost' flag converts amounts to their cost (or selling price)
at transaction time, if they have a transaction price specified.  This
flag is equivalent to '--value=cost', described below.


File: hledger.info,  Node: -V Market value,  Next: -X Market value in specified commodity,  Prev: -B Cost,  Up: Valuation

2.15.2 -V: Market value
-----------------------

The '-V/--market' flag converts reported amounts to their market value
in a default valuation commodity, using the market prices in effect on a
default valuation date.  For single period reports, the valuation date
is today (equivalent to '--value=now'); for multiperiod reports, it is
the last day of each subperiod (equivalent to '--value=end').

   The default valuation commodity is the one referenced in the latest
applicable market price dated on or before the valuation date.  If most
of your P declarations lead to a single home currency, this will usually
be what you want.  (To specify the commodity, see -X below.)

   Note that in hledger, market prices are always declared explicitly
with P directives; we do not infer them from transaction prices as
Ledger does.

   Here's a quick example of -V:

; one euro is worth this many dollars from nov 1
P 2016/11/01 € $1.10

; purchase some euros on nov 3
2016/11/3
    assets:euros        €100
    assets:checking

; the euro is worth fewer dollars by dec 21
P 2016/12/21 € $1.03

   How many euros do I have ?

$ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros
                €100  assets:euros

   What are they worth at end of nov 3 ?

$ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V -e 2016/11/4
             $110.00  assets:euros

   What are they worth after 2016/12/21 ?  (no report end date
specified, defaults to today)

$ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V
             $103.00  assets:euros


File: hledger.info,  Node: -X Market value in specified commodity,  Next: --value Flexible valuation,  Prev: -V Market value,  Up: Valuation

2.15.3 -X: Market value in specified commodity
----------------------------------------------

The '-X/--exchange' option is like '-V', except it specifies the target
commodity you would like to convert to.  It is equivalent to
'--value=now,COMM' or '--value=end,COMM'.

2.15.4 -value: Flexible valuation
---------------------------------

_(experimental, added 201905)_

   '-B', '-V' and '-X' are special cases of the more general '--value'
option:

 --value=TYPE[,COMM]  TYPE is cost, end, now or YYYY-MM-DD.
                      COMM is an optional commodity symbol.
                      Shows amounts converted to:
                      - cost commodity using transaction prices (then optionally to COMM using market prices at period end(s))
                      - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at period end(s)
                      - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using current market prices
                      - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at some date

   The TYPE part basically selects either "cost", or "market value" plus
a valuation date:

'--value=cost'

     Convert amounts to cost, using the prices recorded in transactions.
'--value=end'

     Convert amounts to their value in a default valuation commodity,
     using market prices on the last day of the report period (or if
     unspecified, the journal's end date); or in multiperiod reports,
     market prices on the last day of each subperiod.
'--value=now'

     Convert amounts to their value in default valuation commodity using
     current market prices (as of when report is generated).
'--value=YYYY-MM-DD'

     Convert amounts to their value in default valuation commodity using
     market prices on this date.

   The default valuation commodity is the commodity mentioned in the
most recent applicable market price declaration.  When all your price
declarations lead to a single home currency, this will usually do what
you want.

   To select a different valuation commodity, add the optional ',COMM'
part: a comma, then the target commodity's symbol.  Eg:
*'--value=now,EUR'*.  hledger will do its best to convert amounts to
this commodity, using:

   * declared prices (from source commodity to valuation commodity)
   * reverse prices (declared prices from valuation to source commodity,
     inverted)
   * indirect prices (prices calculated from the shortest chain of
     declared or reverse prices from source to valuation commodity)

   in that order.

   Here are some examples showing the effect of '--value' as seen with
'print':

P 2000-01-01 A  1 B
P 2000-02-01 A  2 B
P 2000-03-01 A  3 B
P 2000-04-01 A  4 B

2000-02-01
  (a)      1 A @ 6 B

2000-03-01
  (a)      1 A @ 7 B

   Show the cost of each posting:

$ hledger -f- print --value=cost
2000/01/01
    (a)             5 B

2000/02/01
    (a)             6 B

2000/03/01
    (a)             7 B

   Show the value as of the last day of the report period (2000-02-29):

$ hledger -f- print --value=end date:2000/01-2000/03
2000-01-01
    (a)             2 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             2 B

   With no report period specified, that shows the value as of the last
day of the journal (2000-03-01):

$ hledger -f- print --value=end
2000/01/01
    (a)             3 B

2000/02/01
    (a)             3 B

2000/03/01
    (a)             3 B

   Show the current value (the 2000-04-01 price is still in effect
today):

$ hledger -f- print --value=now
2000-01-01
    (a)             4 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             4 B

2000-03-01
    (a)             4 B

   Show the value on 2000/01/15:

$ hledger -f- print --value=2000-01-15
2000/01/01
    (a)             1 B

2000/02/01
    (a)             1 B

2000/03/01
    (a)             1 B

   You may need to explicitly set a commodity's display style, when
reverse prices are used.  Eg this output might be surprising:

P 2000-01-01 A 2B

2000-01-01
  a  1B
  b

$ hledger print -x -X A
2000/01/01
    a               0
    b               0

   Explanation: because there's no amount or commodity directive
specifying a display style for A, 0.5A gets the default style, which
shows no decimal digits.  Because the displayed amount looks like zero,
the commodity symbol and minus sign are not displayed either.  Adding a
commodity directive sets a more useful display style for A:

P 2000-01-01 A 2B
commodity 0.00A

2000-01-01
  a  1B
  b

$ hledger print -X A
2000/01/01
    a           0.50A
    b          -0.50A

2.16 Output destination
=======================

Some commands (print, register, stats, the balance commands) can write
their output to a destination other than the console.  This is
controlled by the '-o/--output-file' option.

$ hledger balance -o -     # write to stdout (the default)
$ hledger balance -o FILE  # write to FILE


File: hledger.info,  Node: Output format,  Next: Regular expressions,  Prev: Output destination,  Up: OPTIONS

2.17 Output format
==================

Some commands can write their output in other formats.  Eg print and
register can output CSV, and the balance commands can output CSV or
HTML. This is controlled by the '-O/--output-format' option, or by
specifying a '.csv' or '.html' file extension with '-o/--output-file'.

$ hledger balance -O csv       # write CSV to stdout
$ hledger balance -o FILE.csv  # write CSV to FILE.csv


File: hledger.info,  Node: Regular expressions,  Prev: Output format,  Up: OPTIONS

2.18 Regular expressions
========================

hledger uses regular expressions in a number of places:

   * query terms, on the command line and in the hledger-web search
     form: 'REGEX', 'desc:REGEX', 'cur:REGEX', 'tag:...=REGEX'
   * CSV rules conditional blocks: 'if REGEX ...'
   * account alias directives and options: 'alias /REGEX/ =
     REPLACEMENT', '--alias /REGEX/=REPLACEMENT'

   hledger's regular expressions come from the regex-tdfa library.  In
general they:

   * are case insensitive
   * are infix matching (do not need to match the entire thing being
     matched)
   * are POSIX extended regular expressions
   * also support GNU word boundaries (\<, \>, \b, \B)
   * and parenthesised capturing groups and numeric backreferences in
     replacement strings
   * do not support mode modifiers like (?s)

   Some things to note:

   * In the 'alias' directive and '--alias' option, regular expressions
     must be enclosed in forward slashes ('/REGEX/').  Elsewhere in
     hledger, these are not required.

   * In queries, to match a regular expression metacharacter like '$' as
     a literal character, prepend a backslash.  Eg to search for amounts
     with the dollar sign in hledger-web, write 'cur:\$'.

   * On the command line, some metacharacters like '$' have a special
     meaning to the shell and so must be escaped at least once more.
     See Special characters.


File: hledger.info,  Node: QUERIES,  Next: COMMANDS,  Prev: OPTIONS,  Up: Top

3 QUERIES
*********

One of hledger's strengths is being able to quickly report on precise
subsets of your data.  Most commands accept an optional query
expression, written as arguments after the command name, to filter the
data by date, account name or other criteria.  The syntax is similar to
a web search: one or more space-separated search terms, quotes to
enclose whitespace, prefixes to match specific fields, a not: prefix to
negate the match.

   We do not yet support arbitrary boolean combinations of search terms;
instead most commands show transactions/postings/accounts which match
(or negatively match):

   * any of the description terms AND
   * any of the account terms AND
   * any of the status terms AND
   * all the other terms.

   The print command instead shows transactions which:

   * match any of the description terms AND
   * have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND
   * have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND
   * match all the other terms.

   The following kinds of search terms can be used.  Remember these can
also be prefixed with *'not:'*, eg to exclude a particular subaccount.

*'REGEX', 'acct:REGEX'*

     match account names by this regular expression.  (With no prefix,
     'acct:' is assumed.)  same as above

*'amt:N, amt:<N, amt:<=N, amt:>N, amt:>=N'*

     match postings with a single-commodity amount that is equal to,
     less than, or greater than N. (Multi-commodity amounts are not
     tested, and will always match.)  The comparison has two modes: if N
     is preceded by a + or - sign (or is 0), the two signed numbers are
     compared.  Otherwise, the absolute magnitudes are compared,
     ignoring sign.
*'code:REGEX'*

     match by transaction code (eg check number)
*'cur:REGEX'*

     match postings or transactions including any amounts whose
     currency/commodity symbol is fully matched by REGEX. (For a partial
     match, use '.*REGEX.*').  Note, to match characters which are
     regex-significant, like the dollar sign ('$'), you need to prepend
     '\'.  And when using the command line you need to add one more
     level of quoting to hide it from the shell, so eg do: 'hledger
     print cur:'\$'' or 'hledger print cur:\\$'.
*'desc:REGEX'*

     match transaction descriptions.
*'date:PERIODEXPR'*

     match dates within the specified period.  PERIODEXPR is a period
     expression (with no report interval).  Examples: 'date:2016',
     'date:thismonth', 'date:2000/2/1-2/15', 'date:lastweek-'.  If the
     '--date2' command line flag is present, this matches secondary
     dates instead.
*'date2:PERIODEXPR'*

     match secondary dates within the specified period.
*'depth:N'*

     match (or display, depending on command) accounts at or above this
     depth
*'note:REGEX'*

     match transaction notes (part of description right of '|', or whole
     description when there's no '|')
*'payee:REGEX'*

     match transaction payee/payer names (part of description left of
     '|', or whole description when there's no '|')
*'real:, real:0'*

     match real or virtual postings respectively
*'status:, status:!, status:*'*

     match unmarked, pending, or cleared transactions respectively
*'tag:REGEX[=REGEX]'*

     match by tag name, and optionally also by tag value.  Note a tag:
     query is considered to match a transaction if it matches any of the
     postings.  Also remember that postings inherit the tags of their
     parent transaction.

   The following special search term is used automatically in
hledger-web, only:

*'inacct:ACCTNAME'*

     tells hledger-web to show the transaction register for this
     account.  Can be filtered further with 'acct' etc.

   Some of these can also be expressed as command-line options (eg
'depth:2' is equivalent to '--depth 2').  Generally you can mix options
and query arguments, and the resulting query will be their intersection
(perhaps excluding the '-p/--period' option).

4 COMMANDS
**********

hledger provides a number of subcommands; 'hledger' with no arguments
shows a list.

   If you install additional 'hledger-*' packages, or if you put
programs or scripts named 'hledger-NAME' in your PATH, these will also
be listed as subcommands.

   Run a subcommand by writing its name as first argument (eg 'hledger
incomestatement').  You can also write one of the standard short aliases
displayed in parentheses in the command list ('hledger b'), or any any
unambiguous prefix of a command name ('hledger inc').

   Here are all the builtin commands in alphabetical order.  See also

4.1 accounts
============

accounts, a
Show account names.

   This command lists account names, either declared with account
directives (-declared), posted to (-used), or both (the default).  With
query arguments, only matched account names and account names referenced
by matched postings are shown.  It shows a flat list by default.  With
'--tree', it uses indentation to show the account hierarchy.  In flat
mode you can add '--drop N' to omit the first few account name
components.  Account names can be depth-clipped with 'depth:N' or
'--depth N' or '-N'.

   Examples:

$ hledger accounts
assets:bank:checking
assets:bank:saving
assets:cash
expenses:food
expenses:supplies
income:gifts
income:salary
liabilities:debts

4.2 activity
============

activity
Show an ascii barchart of posting counts per interval.

   The activity command displays an ascii histogram showing transaction
counts by day, week, month or other reporting interval (by day is the
default).  With query arguments, it counts only matched transactions.

   Examples:

$ hledger activity --quarterly
2008-01-01 **
2008-04-01 *******
2008-07-01 
2008-10-01 **


File: hledger.info,  Node: add,  Next: balance,  Prev: activity,  Up: COMMANDS

4.3 add
=======

add
Prompt for transactions and add them to the journal.

   Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor,
or generate them from CSV. For more interactive data entry, there is the
'add' command, which prompts interactively on the console for new
transactions, and appends them to the journal file (if there are
multiple '-f FILE' options, the first file is used.)  Existing
transactions are not changed.  This is the only hledger command that
writes to the journal file.

   To use it, just run 'hledger add' and follow the prompts.  You can
add as many transactions as you like; when you are finished, enter '.'
or press control-d or control-c to exit.

   Features:

   * add tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar (by
     description) recent transaction (filtered by the query, if any) as
     a template.
   * You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.
   * Readline-style edit keys can be used during data entry.
   * The tab key will auto-complete whenever possible - accounts,
     descriptions, dates ('yesterday', 'today', 'tomorrow').  If the
     input area is empty, it will insert the default value.
   * If the journal defines a default commodity, it will be added to any
     bare numbers entered.
   * A parenthesised transaction code may be entered following a date.
   * Comments and tags may be entered following a description or amount.
   * If you make a mistake, enter '<' at any prompt to restart the
     transaction.
   * Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when the terminal
     supports it.

   Example (see the tutorial for a detailed explanation):

$ hledger add
Adding transactions to journal file /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to restart the transaction.
To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control-d or control-c.
Date [2015/05/22]: 
Description: supermarket
Account 1: expenses:food
Amount  1: $10
Account 2: assets:checking
Amount  2 [$-10.0]: 
Account 3 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
2015/05/22 supermarket
    expenses:food             $10
    assets:checking        $-10.0

Save this transaction to the journal ? [y]: 
Saved.
Starting the next transaction (. or ctrl-D/ctrl-C to quit)
Date [2015/05/22]: <CTRL-D> $

   On Microsoft Windows, the add command makes sure that no part of the
file path ends with a period, as it can cause data loss on that platform
(cf #1056).


File: hledger.info,  Node: balance,  Next: balancesheet,  Prev: add,  Up: COMMANDS

4.4 balance
===========

balance, bal, b
Show accounts and their balances.

   The balance command is hledger's most versatile command.  Note,
despite the name, it is not always used for showing real-world account
balances; the more accounting-aware balancesheet and incomestatement may
be more convenient for that.

   By default, it displays all accounts, and each account's change in
balance during the entire period of the journal.  Balance changes are
calculated by adding up the postings in each account.  You can limit the
postings matched, by a query, to see fewer accounts, changes over a
different time period, changes from only cleared transactions, etc.

   If you include an account's complete history of postings in the
report, the balance change is equivalent to the account's current ending
balance.  For a real-world account, typically you won't have all
transactions in the journal; instead you'll have all transactions after
a certain date, and an "opening balances" transaction setting the
correct starting balance on that date.  Then the balance command will
show real-world account balances.  In some cases the -H/-historical flag
is used to ensure this (more below).

   The balance command can produce several styles of report:

* Menu:

* Classic balance report::
* Customising the classic balance report::
* Colour support::
* Flat mode::
* Depth limited balance reports::
* Multicolumn balance report::
* Budget report::
* Output format::


File: hledger.info,  Node: Classic balance report,  Next: Customising the classic balance report,  Up: balance

4.4.1 Classic balance report
----------------------------

This is the original balance report, as found in Ledger.  It usually
looks like this:

$ hledger balance
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0

   By default, accounts are displayed hierarchically, with subaccounts
indented below their parent.  At each level of the tree, accounts are
sorted by account code if any, then by account name.  Or with
'-S/--sort-amount', by their balance amount.

   "Boring" accounts, which contain a single interesting subaccount and
no balance of their own, are elided into the following line for more
compact output.  (Eg above, the "liabilities" account.)  Use
'--no-elide' to prevent this.

   Account balances are "inclusive" - they include the balances of any
subaccounts.

   Accounts which have zero balance (and no non-zero subaccounts) are
omitted.  Use '-E/--empty' to show them.

   A final total is displayed by default; use '-N/--no-total' to
suppress it, eg:

$ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses --no-total
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies


File: hledger.info,  Node: Customising the classic balance report,  Next: Colour support,  Prev: Classic balance report,  Up: balance

4.4.2 Customising the classic balance report
--------------------------------------------

You can customise the layout of classic balance reports with '--format
FMT':

$ hledger balance --format "%20(account) %12(total)"
              assets          $-1
         bank:saving           $1
                cash          $-2
            expenses           $2
                food           $1
            supplies           $1
              income          $-2
               gifts          $-1
              salary          $-1
   liabilities:debts           $1
---------------------------------
                                0

   The FMT format string (plus a newline) specifies the formatting
applied to each account/balance pair.  It may contain any suitable text,
with data fields interpolated like so:

   '%[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)'

   * MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)

   * MAX truncates at this width (optional)

   * FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:

        * 'depth_spacer' - a number of spaces equal to the account's
          depth, or if MIN is specified, MIN * depth spaces.
        * 'account' - the account's name
        * 'total' - the account's balance/posted total, right justified

   Also, FMT can begin with an optional prefix to control how
multi-commodity amounts are rendered:

   * '%_' - render on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)
   * '%^' - render on multiple lines, top-aligned
   * '%,' - render on one line, comma-separated

   There are some quirks.  Eg in one-line mode, '%(depth_spacer)' has no
effect, instead '%(account)' has indentation built in.  Experimentation
may be needed to get pleasing results.

   Some example formats:

   * '%(total)' - the account's total
   * '%-20.20(account)' - the account's name, left justified, padded to
     20 characters and clipped at 20 characters
   * '%,%-50(account) %25(total)' - account name padded to 50
     characters, total padded to 20 characters, with multiple
     commodities rendered on one line
   * '%20(total) %2(depth_spacer)%-(account)' - the default format for
     the single-column balance report

4.4.4 Flat mode
---------------

To see a flat list instead of the default hierarchical display, use
'--flat'.  In this mode, accounts (unless depth-clipped) show their full
names and "exclusive" balance, excluding any subaccount balances.  In
this mode, you can also use '--drop N' to omit the first few account
name components.

$ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses -N --flat --drop 1
                  $1  food
                  $1  supplies


File: hledger.info,  Node: Depth limited balance reports,  Next: Multicolumn balance report,  Prev: Flat mode,  Up: balance

4.4.5 Depth limited balance reports
-----------------------------------

With '--depth N' or 'depth:N' or just '-N', balance reports show
accounts only to the specified numeric depth.  This is very useful to
summarise a complex set of accounts and get an overview.

$ hledger balance -N -1
                 $-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $-2  income
                  $1  liabilities

   Flat-mode balance reports, which normally show exclusive balances,
show inclusive balances at the depth limit.


File: hledger.info,  Node: Multicolumn balance report,  Next: Budget report,  Prev: Depth limited balance reports,  Up: balance

4.4.6 Multicolumn balance report
--------------------------------

Multicolumn or tabular balance reports are a very useful hledger
feature, and usually the preferred style.  They share many of the above
features, but they show the report as a table, with columns representing
time periods.  This mode is activated by providing a reporting interval.

   There are three types of multicolumn balance report, showing
different information:

  1. By default: each column shows the sum of postings in that period,
     ie the account's change of balance in that period.  This is useful
     eg for a monthly income statement:

     $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E
     Balance changes in 2008:
     
                        ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4 
     ===================++=================================
      expenses:food     ||       0      $1       0       0 
      expenses:supplies ||       0      $1       0       0 
      income:gifts      ||       0     $-1       0       0 
      income:salary     ||     $-1       0       0       0 
     -------------------++---------------------------------
                        ||     $-1      $1       0       0 

  2. With '--cumulative': each column shows the ending balance for that
     period, accumulating the changes across periods, starting from 0 at
     the report start date:

     $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E --cumulative
     Ending balances (cumulative) in 2008:
     
                        ||  2008/03/31  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31 
     ===================++=================================================
      expenses:food     ||           0          $1          $1          $1 
      expenses:supplies ||           0          $1          $1          $1 
      income:gifts      ||           0         $-1         $-1         $-1 
      income:salary     ||         $-1         $-1         $-1         $-1 
     -------------------++-------------------------------------------------
                        ||         $-1           0           0           0 

  3. With '--historical/-H': each column shows the actual historical
     ending balance for that period, accumulating the changes across
     periods, starting from the actual balance at the report start date.
     This is useful eg for a multi-period balance sheet, and when you
     are showing only the data after a certain start date:

     $ hledger balance ^assets ^liabilities --quarterly --historical --begin 2008/4/1
     Ending balances (historical) in 2008/04/01-2008/12/31:
     
                           ||  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31 
     ======================++=====================================
      assets:bank:checking ||          $1          $1           0 
      assets:bank:saving   ||          $1          $1          $1 
      assets:cash          ||         $-2         $-2         $-2 
      liabilities:debts    ||           0           0          $1 
     ----------------------++-------------------------------------
                           ||           0           0           0 

   Note that '--cumulative' or '--historical/-H' disable
'--row-total/-T', since summing end balances generally does not make
sense.

   Multicolumn balance reports display accounts in flat mode by default;
to see the hierarchy, use '--tree'.

   With a reporting interval (like '--quarterly' above), the report
start/end dates will be adjusted if necessary so that they encompass the
displayed report periods.  This is so that the first and last periods
will be "full" and comparable to the others.

   The '-E/--empty' flag does two things in multicolumn balance reports:
first, the report will show all columns within the specified report
period (without -E, leading and trailing columns with all zeroes are not
shown).  Second, all accounts which existed at the report start date
will be considered, not just the ones with activity during the report
period (use -E to include low-activity accounts which would otherwise
would be omitted).

   The '-T/--row-total' flag adds an additional column showing the total
for each row.

   The '-A/--average' flag adds a column showing the average value in
each row.

   Here's an example of all three:

$ hledger balance -Q income expenses --tree -ETA
Balance changes in 2008:

            ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4    Total  Average 
============++===================================================
 expenses   ||       0      $2       0       0       $2       $1 
   food     ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0 
   supplies ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0 
 income     ||     $-1     $-1       0       0      $-2      $-1 
   gifts    ||       0     $-1       0       0      $-1        0 
   salary   ||     $-1       0       0       0      $-1        0 
------------++---------------------------------------------------
            ||     $-1      $1       0       0        0        0 

# Average is rounded to the dollar here since all journal amounts are

   Limitations:

   In multicolumn reports the '-V/--value' flag uses the market price on
the report end date, for all columns (not the price on each column's end
date).

   Eliding of boring parent accounts in tree mode, as in the classic
balance report, is not yet supported in multicolumn reports.

4.4.7 Budget report
-------------------

With '--budget', extra columns are displayed showing budget goals for
each account and period, if any.  Budget goals are defined by periodic
transactions.  This is very useful for comparing planned and actual
income, expenses, time usage, etc.  -budget is most often combined with
a report interval.

   For example, you can take average monthly expenses in the common
expense categories to construct a minimal monthly budget:

;; Budget
~ monthly
  income  $2000
  expenses:food    $400
  expenses:bus     $50
  expenses:movies  $30
  assets:bank:checking

;; Two months worth of expenses
2017-11-01
  income  $1950
  expenses:food    $396
  expenses:bus     $49
  expenses:movies  $30
  expenses:supplies  $20
  assets:bank:checking

2017-12-01
  income  $2100
  expenses:food    $412
  expenses:bus     $53
  expenses:gifts   $100
  assets:bank:checking

   You can now see a monthly budget report:

$ hledger balance -M --budget
Budget performance in 2017/11/01-2017/12/31:

                      ||                      Nov                       Dec 
======================++====================================================
 assets               || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank          || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank:checking || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 expenses             ||   $495 [ 103% of   $480]    $565 [ 118% of   $480] 
 expenses:bus         ||    $49 [  98% of    $50]     $53 [ 106% of    $50] 
 expenses:food        ||   $396 [  99% of   $400]    $412 [ 103% of   $400] 
 expenses:movies      ||    $30 [ 100% of    $30]       0 [   0% of    $30] 
 income               ||  $1950 [  98% of  $2000]   $2100 [ 105% of  $2000] 
----------------------++----------------------------------------------------
                      ||      0 [              0]       0 [              0] 

   Note this is different from a normal balance report in several ways:

   * Only accounts with budget goals during the report period are shown,
     by default.

   * In each column, in square brackets after the actual amount,
     budgeted amounts are shown, along with the percentage of budget
     used.

   * All parent accounts are always shown, even in flat mode.  Eg
     assets, assets:bank, and expenses above.

   * Amounts always include all subaccounts, budgeted or unbudgeted,
     even in flat mode.

   This means that the numbers displayed will not always add up!  Eg
above, the 'expenses' actual amount includes the gifts and supplies
transactions, but the 'expenses:gifts' and 'expenses:supplies' accounts
are not shown, as they have no budget amounts declared.

   This can be confusing.  When you need to make things clearer, use the
'-E/--empty' flag, which will reveal all accounts including unbudgeted
ones, giving the full picture.  Eg:

$ hledger balance -M --budget --empty
Budget performance in 2017/11/01-2017/12/31:

                      ||                      Nov                       Dec 
======================++====================================================
 assets               || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank          || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank:checking || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 expenses             ||   $495 [ 103% of   $480]    $565 [ 118% of   $480]

File: hledger.info,  Node: Nested budgets,  Up: Budget report

4.4.7.1 Nested budgets
......................

You can add budgets to any account in your account hierarchy.  If you
have budgets on both parent account and some of its children, then
budget(s) of the child account(s) would be added to the budget of their
parent, much like account balances behave.

   In the most simple case this means that once you add a budget to any
account, all its parents would have budget as well.

   To illustrate this, consider the following budget:

~ monthly from 2019/01
    expenses:personal             $1,000.00
    expenses:personal:electronics    $100.00
    liabilities

   With this, monthly budget for electronics is defined to be $100 and
budget for personal expenses is an additional $1000, which implicity
means that budget for both 'expenses:personal' and 'expenses' is $1100.

   Transactions in 'expenses:personal:electronics' will be counted both
towards its $100 budget and $1100 of 'expenses:personal' , and
transactions in any other subaccount of 'expenses:personal' would be
counted towards only towards the budget of 'expenses:personal'.

   For example, let's consider these transactions:

~ monthly from 2019/01
    expenses:personal             $1,000.00
    expenses:personal:electronics    $100.00
    liabilities

2019/01/01 Google home hub
    expenses:personal:electronics          $90.00
    liabilities                           $-90.00

2019/01/02 Phone screen protector
    expenses:personal:electronics:upgrades          $10.00
    liabilities

2019/01/02 Weekly train ticket
    expenses:personal:train tickets       $153.00
    liabilities

2019/01/03 Flowers
    expenses:personal          $30.00
    liabilities

   As you can see, we have transactions in
'expenses:personal:electronics:upgrades' and 'expenses:personal:train
tickets', and since both of these accounts are without explicitly
defined budget, these transactions would be counted towards budgets of
'expenses:personal:electronics' and 'expenses:personal' accordingly:

$ hledger balance --budget -M
Budget performance in 2019/01:

                               ||                           Jan 
===============================++===============================
 expenses                      ||  $283.00 [  26% of  $1100.00] 
 expenses:personal             ||  $283.00 [  26% of  $1100.00] 
 expenses:personal:electronics ||  $100.00 [ 100% of   $100.00]

   And with '--empty', we can get a better picture of budget allocation
and consumption:

4.4.8 Output format
-------------------

The balance command supports output destination and output format
selection.


File: hledger.info,  Node: balancesheet,  Next: balancesheetequity,  Prev: balance,  Up: COMMANDS

4.5 balancesheet
================

balancesheet, bs
This command displays a simple balance sheet, showing historical ending
balances of asset and liability accounts (ignoring any report begin
date).  It assumes that these accounts are under a top-level 'asset' or
'liability' account (case insensitive, plural forms also allowed).

   Note this report shows all account balances with normal positive sign
(like conventional financial statements, unlike balance/print/register)
(experimental).

   Example:

$ hledger balancesheet
Balance Sheet

Assets:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Liabilities:
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                  $1

Total:
--------------------
                   0

   With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for
each report period.  As with multicolumn balance reports, you can alter
the report mode with '--change'/'--cumulative'/'--historical'.  Normally
balancesheet shows historical ending balances, which is what you need
for a balance sheet; note this means it ignores report begin dates (and
'-T/--row-total', since summing end balances generally does not make
sense).

   This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.


File: hledger.info,  Node: balancesheetequity,  Next: cashflow,  Prev: balancesheet,  Up: COMMANDS

4.6 balancesheetequity
======================

balancesheetequity, bse
Just like balancesheet, but also reports Equity (which it assumes is
under a top-level 'equity' account).

   Example:

$ hledger balancesheetequity
Balance Sheet With Equity

Assets:
                 $-2  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-3    cash
--------------------
                 $-2

Liabilities:
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                  $1

File: hledger.info,  Node: cashflow,  Next: check-dates,  Prev: balancesheetequity,  Up: COMMANDS

4.7 cashflow
============

cashflow, cf
This command displays a simple cashflow statement, showing changes in
"cash" accounts.  It assumes that these accounts are under a top-level
'asset' account (case insensitive, plural forms also allowed) and do not
contain 'receivable' or 'A/R' in their name.  Note this report shows all
account balances with normal positive sign (like conventional financial
statements, unlike balance/print/register) (experimental).

   Example:

$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement

Cash flows:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Total:
--------------------
                 $-1

   With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for
each report period.  Normally cashflow shows changes in assets per
period, though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the
report mode with '--change'/'--cumulative'/'--historical'.

   This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.


File: hledger.info,  Node: check-dates,  Next: check-dupes,  Prev: cashflow,  Up: COMMANDS

4.8 check-dates
===============

check-dates
Check that transactions are sorted by increasing date.  With -date2,
checks secondary dates instead.  With -strict, dates must also be
unique.  With a query, only matched transactions' dates are checked.
Reads the default journal file, or another specified with -f.


File: hledger.info,  Node: check-dupes,  Next: close,  Prev: check-dates,  Up: COMMANDS

4.9 check-dupes
===============

check-dupes
Reports account names having the same leaf but different prefixes.  In
other words, two or more leaves that are categorized differently.  Reads
the default journal file, or another specified as an argument.

   An example: http://stefanorodighiero.net/software/hledger-dupes.html


File: hledger.info,  Node: close,  Next: commodities,  Prev: check-dupes,  Up: COMMANDS

4.10 close
==========

close, equity
Prints a "closing balances" transaction and an "opening balances"
transaction that bring account balances to and from zero, respectively.
Useful for bringing asset/liability balances forward into a new journal
file, or for closing out revenues/expenses to retained earnings at the
end of a period.

   The closing transaction transfers balances to "equity:closing
balances".  The opening transaction transfers balances from
"equity:opening balances".  You can choose to print just one of the
transactions by using the '--opening' or '--closing' flag.

   If you split your journal files by time (eg yearly), you will
typically run this command at the end of the year, and save the closing
transaction as last entry of the old file, and the opening transaction
as the first entry of the new file.  This makes the files self
contained, so that correct balances are reported no matter which of them
are loaded.  Ie, if you load just one file, the balances are initialised
correctly; or if you load several files, the redundant closing/opening
transactions cancel each other out.  (They will show up in print or
register reports; you can exclude them with a query like
'not:desc:'(opening|closing) balances''.)

   If you're running a business, you might also use this command to
"close the books" at the end of an accounting period, transferring
income statement account balances to retained earnings.  (You may want
to change the equity account name to something like "equity:retained
earnings".)

   By default, the closing transaction is dated yesterday, the balances
are calculated as of end of yesterday, and the opening transaction is
dated today.  To close on some other date, use: 'hledger close -e
OPENINGDATE'.  Eg, to close/open on the 2018/2019 boundary, use '-e
2019'.  You can also use -p or 'date:PERIOD' (any starting date is
ignored).

   Both transactions will include balance assertions for the
closed/reopened accounts.  You probably shouldn't use status or realness
filters (like -C or -R or 'status:') with this command, or the generated
balance assertions will depend on these flags.  Likewise, if you run
this command with -auto, the balance assertions will probably always
require -auto.

   When account balances have cost information (transaction prices), the
closing/opening transactions will preserve it, so that eg balance -B
reports will not be affected.

   Examples:

   Carrying asset/liability balances into a new file for 2019, all from
command line:

   _Warning: we use '>>' here to append; be careful not to type a single
'>' which would wipe your journal!_

$ hledger close -f 2018.journal -e 2019 assets liabilities --opening >>2019.journal
$ hledger close -f 2018.journal -e 2019 assets liabilities --closing >>2018.journal

   Now:

$ hledger bs -f 2019.journal                   # one file - balances are correct
$ hledger bs -f 2018.journal -f 2019.journal   # two files - balances still correct
$ hledger bs -f 2018.journal not:desc:closing  # to see year-end balances, must exclude closing txn

   Transactions spanning the closing date can complicate matters,
breaking balance assertions:

2018/12/30 a purchase made in 2018, clearing the following year
    expenses:food          5
    assets:bank:checking  -5  ; [2019/1/2]

   Here's one way to resolve that:

; in 2018.journal:
2018/12/30 a purchase made in 2018, clearing the following year
    expenses:food          5
    liabilities:pending

; in 2019.journal:
2019/1/2 clearance of last year's pending transactions
    liabilities:pending    5 = 0
    assets:checking

4.13 diff
=========

diff
Compares a particular account's transactions in two input files.  It
shows any transactions to this account which are in one file but not in
the other.

   More precisely, for each posting affecting this account in either
file, it looks for a corresponding posting in the other file which posts
the same amount to the same account (ignoring date, description, etc.)
Since postings not transactions are compared, this also works when
multiple bank transactions have been combined into a single journal
entry.

   This is useful eg if you have downloaded an account's transactions
from your bank (eg as CSV data).  When hledger and your bank disagree
about the account balance, you can compare the bank data with your
journal to find out the cause.

   Examples:

$ hledger diff -f $LEDGER_FILE -f bank.csv assets:bank:giro 
These transactions are in the first file only:

2014/01/01 Opening Balances
    assets:bank:giro              EUR ...
    ...
    equity:opening balances       EUR -...

4.15 help
=========

help
Show any of the hledger manuals.

   The 'help' command displays any of the main hledger manuals, in one
of several ways.  Run it with no argument to list the manuals, or
provide a full or partial manual name to select one.

   hledger manuals are available in several formats.  hledger help will
use the first of these display methods that it finds: info, man, $PAGER,
less, stdout (or when non-interactive, just stdout).  You can force a
particular viewer with the '--info', '--man', '--pager', '--cat' flags.

   Examples:

$ hledger help
Please choose a manual by typing "hledger help MANUAL" (a substring is ok).
Manuals: hledger hledger-ui hledger-web journal csv timeclock timedot

$ hledger help h --man

       hledger [-f FILE] ADDONCMD -- [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       hledger  is  a  cross-platform  program  for tracking money, time, or any

File: hledger.info,  Node: import,  Next: incomestatement,  Prev: help,  Up: COMMANDS

4.16 import
===========

import
Read new transactions added to each FILE since last run, and add them to
the main journal file.  Or with -dry-run, just print the transactions
that would be added.  Or with -catchup, just mark all of the FILEs'
transactions as imported, without actually importing any.

   The input files are specified as arguments - no need to write -f
before each one.  So eg to add new transactions from all CSV files to
the main journal, it's just: 'hledger import *.csv'

   New transactions are detected in the same way as print -new: by
assuming transactions are always added to the input files in increasing
date order, and by saving '.latest.FILE' state files.

   The -dry-run output is in journal format, so you can filter it, eg to
see only uncategorised transactions:

$ hledger import --dry ... | hledger -f- print unknown --ignore-assertions

* Importing balance assignments::


File: hledger.info,  Node: Importing balance assignments,  Up: import

4.16.1 Importing balance assignments
------------------------------------

Entries added by import will have their posting amounts made explicit
(like 'hledger print -x').  This means that any balance assignments in
imported files must be evaluated; but, imported files don't get to see
the main file's account balances.  As a result, importing entries with
balance assignments (eg from an institution that provides only balances
and not posting amounts) will probably generate incorrect posting
amounts.  To avoid this problem, use print instead of import:

$ hledger print IMPORTFILE [--new] >> $LEDGER_FILE

   (If you think import should leave amounts implicit like print does,
please test it and send a pull request.)

4.17 incomestatement
====================

incomestatement, is
This command displays a simple income statement, showing revenues and
expenses during a period.  It assumes that these accounts are under a
top-level 'revenue' or 'income' or 'expense' account (case insensitive,
plural forms also allowed).  Note this report shows all account balances
with normal positive sign (like conventional financial statements,
unlike balance/print/register) (experimental).

   This command displays a simple income statement.  It currently
assumes that you have top-level accounts named 'income' (or 'revenue')
and 'expense' (plural forms also allowed.)

$ hledger incomestatement
Income Statement

Revenues:
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
--------------------
                 $-2

Expenses:
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
--------------------
                  $2

Total:
--------------------
                   0

   With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for
each report period.  Normally incomestatement shows revenues/expenses
per period, though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the
report mode with '--change'/'--cumulative'/'--historical'.

   This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.

4.21 print
==========

print, txns, p
Show transaction journal entries, sorted by date.

   The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from
the journal file in date order, tidily formatted.  With -date2,
transactions are sorted by secondary date instead.

   print's output is always a valid hledger journal.
It preserves all transaction information, but it does not preserve
directives or inter-transaction comments

$ hledger print
2008/01/01 income
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:salary                  $-1

2008/06/01 gift
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:gifts                   $-1

2008/06/02 save
    assets:bank:saving              $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1

2008/06/03 * eat & shop
    expenses:food                $1
    expenses:supplies            $1
    assets:cash                 $-2

2008/12/31 * pay off
    liabilities:debts               $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1

   Normally, the journal entry's explicit or implicit amount style is
preserved.  Ie when an amount is omitted in the journal, it will be
omitted in the output.  You can use the '-x'/'--explicit' flag to make
all amounts explicit, which can be useful for troubleshooting or for
making your journal more readable and robust against data entry errors.
Note, '-x' will cause postings with a multi-commodity amount (these can
arise when a multi-commodity transaction has an implicit amount) will be
split into multiple single-commodity postings, for valid journal output.

   With '-B'/'--cost', amounts with transaction prices are converted to
cost using that price.  This can be used for troubleshooting.

   With '-m'/'--match' and a STR argument, print will show at most one
transaction: the one one whose description is most similar to STR, and
is most recent.  STR should contain at least two characters.  If there
is no similar-enough match, no transaction will be shown.

   With '--new', for each FILE being read, hledger reads (and writes) a
special state file ('.latest.FILE' in the same directory), containing
the latest transaction date(s) that were seen last time FILE was read.
When this file is found, only transactions with newer dates (and new
transactions on the latest date) are printed.  This is useful for
ignoring already-seen entries in import data, such as downloaded CSV
files.  Eg:

$ hledger -f bank1.csv print --new
# shows transactions added since last print --new on this file

   This assumes that transactions added to FILE always have same or
increasing dates, and that transactions on the same day do not get
reordered.  See also the import command.

   This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.  Here's an example of print's CSV output:

$ hledger print -Ocsv
"txnidx","date","date2","status","code","description","comment","account","amount","commodity","credit","debit","posting-status","posting-comment"
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","income:salary","-1","$","1","","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""

"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""

   * There is one CSV record per posting, with the parent transaction's
     fields repeated.
   * The "txnidx" (transaction index) field shows which postings belong
     to the same transaction.  (This number might change if transactions
     are reordered within the file, files are parsed/included in a
     different order, etc.)
   * The amount is separated into "commodity" (the symbol) and "amount"
     (numeric quantity) fields.
   * The numeric amount is repeated in either the "credit" or "debit"
     column, for convenience.  (Those names are not accurate in the
     accounting sense; it just puts negative amounts under credit and
     zero or greater amounts under debit.)

4.23 register
=============

register, reg, r
Show postings and their running total.

   The register command displays postings in date order, one per line,
and their running total.  This is typically used with a query selecting
a particular account, to see that account's activity:

$ hledger register checking
2008/01/01 income               assets:bank:checking            $1           $1
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0

   With -date2, it shows and sorts by secondary date instead.

   The '--historical'/'-H' flag adds the balance from any undisplayed
prior postings to the running total.  This is useful when you want to
see only recent activity, with a historically accurate running balance:

$ hledger register checking -b 2008/6 --historical
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0

   The '--depth' option limits the amount of sub-account detail
displayed.

   The '--average'/'-A' flag shows the running average posting amount
instead of the running total (so, the final number displayed is the
average for the whole report period).  This flag implies '--empty' (see
below).  It is affected by '--historical'.  It works best when showing
just one account and one commodity.

   The '--related'/'-r' flag shows the _other_ postings in the
transactions of the postings which would normally be shown.

   The '--invert' flag negates all amounts.  For example, it can be used
on an income account where amounts are normally displayed as negative
numbers.  It's also useful to show postings on the checking account
together with the related account:

$ hledger register --related --invert assets:checking

   With a reporting interval, register shows summary postings, one per
interval, aggregating the postings to each account:

$ hledger register --monthly income
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2

   Periods with no activity, and summary postings with a zero amount,
are not shown by default; use the '--empty'/'-E' flag to see them:

$ hledger register --monthly income -E
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
2008/02                                                          0          $-1
2008/03                                                          0          $-1
2008/04                                                          0          $-1
2008/05                                                          0          $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2
2008/07                                                          0          $-2
2008/08                                                          0          $-2
2008/09                                                          0          $-2
2008/10                                                          0          $-2
2008/11                                                          0          $-2
2008/12                                                          0          $-2

   Often, you'll want to see just one line per interval.  The '--depth'
option helps with this, causing subaccounts to be aggregated:

$ hledger register --monthly assets --depth 1h
2008/01                 assets                                  $1           $1
2008/06                 assets                                 $-1            0
2008/12                 assets                                 $-1          $-1

   Note when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates
these will be adjusted outward if necessary to contain a whole number of
intervals.  This ensures that the first and last intervals are full
length and comparable to the others in the report.

* Custom register output::


File: hledger.info,  Node: Custom register output,  Up: register

4.23.1 Custom register output
-----------------------------

register uses the full terminal width by default, except on windows.
You can override this by setting the 'COLUMNS' environment variable (not
a bash shell variable) or by using the '--width'/'-w' option.

   The description and account columns normally share the space equally
(about half of (width - 40) each).  You can adjust this by adding a
description width as part of -width's argument, comma-separated:
'--width W,D' .  Here's a diagram (won't display correctly in -help):

<--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA

   and some examples:

$ hledger reg                     # use terminal width (or 80 on windows)
$ hledger reg -w 100              # use width 100
$ COLUMNS=100 hledger reg         # set with one-time environment variable
$ export COLUMNS=100; hledger reg # set till session end (or window resize)
$ hledger reg -w 100,40           # set overall width 100, description width 40
$ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,40      # use terminal width, & description width 40

   This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.

4.24 register-match
===================

register-match
Print the one posting whose transaction description is closest to DESC,
in the style of the register command.  If there are multiple equally
good matches, it shows the most recent.  Query options (options, not
arguments) can be used to restrict the search space.  Helps
ledger-autosync detect already-seen transactions when importing.

4.25 rewrite
============

rewrite
Print all transactions, rewriting the postings of matched transactions.
For now the only rewrite available is adding new postings, like print
-auto.

   This is a start at a generic rewriter of transaction entries.  It
reads the default journal and prints the transactions, like print, but
adds one or more specified postings to any transactions matching QUERY.
The posting amounts can be fixed, or a multiplier of the existing
transaction's first posting amount.

   Examples:

$ hledger-rewrite.hs ^income --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33  ; income tax' --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  $100'
$ hledger-rewrite.hs expenses:gifts --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  *-1"'
$ hledger-rewrite.hs -f rewrites.hledger

   rewrites.hledger may consist of entries like:

= ^income amt:<0 date:2017
  (liabilities:tax)  *0.33  ; tax on income
  (reserve:grocery)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery
  (reserve:)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery

   Note the single quotes to protect the dollar sign from bash, and the
two spaces between account and amount.

   More:

$ hledger rewrite -- [QUERY]        --add-posting "ACCT  AMTEXPR" ...
$ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'
$ hledger rewrite -- expenses:gifts --add-posting '(budget:gifts)  *-1"'
$ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(budget:foreign currency)  *0.25 JPY; diversify'

   Argument for '--add-posting' option is a usual posting of transaction
with an exception for amount specification.  More precisely, you can use
''*'' (star symbol) before the amount to indicate that that this is a
factor for an amount of original matched posting.  If the amount
includes a commodity name, the new posting amount will be in the new
commodity; otherwise, it will be in the matched posting amount's
commodity.

File: hledger.info,  Node: Re-write rules in a file,  Up: rewrite

4.25.1 Re-write rules in a file
-------------------------------

During the run this tool will execute so called "Automated Transactions"
found in any journal it process.  I.e instead of specifying this
operations in command line you can put them in a journal file.

$ rewrite-rules.journal

   Make contents look like this:

= ^income
    (liabilities:tax)  *.33

= expenses:gifts
    budget:gifts  *-1
    assets:budget  *1

   Note that ''='' (equality symbol) that is used instead of date in
transactions you usually write.  It indicates the query by which you
want to match the posting to add new ones.

$ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal -f rewrite-rules.journal > rewritten-tidy-output.journal

   This is something similar to the commands pipeline:

$ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33' \
  | hledger rewrite -- -f - expenses:gifts      --add-posting 'budget:gifts  *-1'       \
                                                --add-posting 'assets:budget  *1'       \
  > rewritten-tidy-output.journal

   It is important to understand that relative order of such entries in
journal is important.  You can re-use result of previously added
postings.

To use this tool for batch modification of your journal files you may
find useful output in form of unified diff.

$ hledger rewrite -- --diff -f examples/sample.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'

4.25.1.2 rewrite vs. print -auto
................................

This command predates print -auto, and currently does much the same
thing, but with these differences:

   * with multiple files, rewrite lets rules in any file affect all
     other files.  print -auto uses standard directive scoping; rules
     affect only child files.

   * rewrite's query limits which transactions can be rewritten; all are
     printed.  print -auto's query limits which transactions are
     printed.

   * rewrite applies rules specified on command line or in the journal.
     print -auto applies rules specified in the journal.


File: hledger.info,  Node: roi,  Next: stats,  Prev: rewrite,  Up: COMMANDS

4.26 roi
========

roi
Shows the time-weighted (TWR) and money-weighted (IRR) rate of return on
your investments.

   This command assumes that you have account(s) that hold nothing but
your investments and whenever you record current appraisal/valuation of
these investments you offset unrealized profit and loss into account(s)
that, again, hold nothing but unrealized profit and loss.

   Any transactions affecting balance of investment account(s) and not
originating from unrealized profit and loss account(s) are assumed to be
your investments or withdrawals.

   At a minimum, you need to supply a query (which could be just an
account name) to select your investments with '--inv', and another query
to identify your profit and loss transactions with '--pnl'.

   It will compute and display the internalized rate of return (IRR) and
time-weighted rate of return (TWR) for your investments for the time
period requested.  Both rates of return are annualized before display,
regardless of the length of reporting interval.

4.27 stats
==========

stats
Show some journal statistics.

   The stats command displays summary information for the whole journal,
or a matched part of it.  With a reporting interval, it shows a report
for each report period.

   Example:

$ hledger stats
Main journal file        : /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
Included journal files   : 
Transactions span        : 2008-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (366 days)
Last transaction         : 2008-12-31 (2333 days ago)
Transactions             : 5 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions      : 5

Commodities              : 1 ($)
Market prices            : 12 ($)

   This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.


File: hledger.info,  Node: tags,  Next: test,  Prev: stats,  Up: COMMANDS

4.28 tags
=========

tags
List all the tag names used in the journal.  With a TAGREGEX argument,
only tag names matching the regular expression (case insensitive) are
shown.  With QUERY arguments, only transactions matching the query are
considered.  With -values flag, the tags' unique values are listed
instead.


File: hledger.info,  Node: test,  Prev: tags,  Up: COMMANDS

4.29 test
=========

test
Run built-in unit tests.

   This command runs the unit tests built in to hledger-lib and hledger,
printing test names and results on stdout.  If any test fails, the exit
code will be non-zero.

   Test names include a group prefix.  If a (exact, case sensitive)
group prefix, or a full test name is provided as the first argument,
only that group or test is run.

   If a numeric second argument is provided, it will set the randomness
seed, for repeatable results from tests using randomness (currently none
of them).

   This is mainly used by developers, but it's nice to be able to
sanity-check your installed hledger executable at any time.  All tests
are expected to pass - if you ever see otherwise, something has gone
wrong, please report a bug!


File: hledger.info,  Node: ADD-ON COMMANDS,  Prev: COMMANDS,  Up: Top

5 ADD-ON COMMANDS
*****************

hledger also searches for external add-on commands, and will include
these in the commands list.  These are programs or scripts in your PATH
whose name starts with 'hledger-' and ends with a recognised file
extension (currently: no extension, 'bat','com','exe',
'hs','lhs','pl','py','rb','rkt','sh').

   Add-ons can be invoked like any hledger command, but there are a few
things to be aware of.  Eg if the 'hledger-web' add-on is installed,

   * 'hledger -h web' shows hledger's help, while 'hledger web -h' shows
     hledger-web's help.

   * Flags specific to the add-on must have a preceding '--' to hide
     them from hledger.  So 'hledger web --serve --port 9000' will be
     rejected; you must use 'hledger web -- --serve --port 9000'.

   * You can always run add-ons directly if preferred: 'hledger-web
     --serve --port 9000'.

   Add-ons are a relatively easy way to add local features or experiment
with new ideas.  They can be written in any language, but haskell
scripts have a big advantage: they can use the same hledger (and
haskell) library functions that built-in commands do, for command-line
options, journal parsing, reporting, etc.
