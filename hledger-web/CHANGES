0.25 (2015/4/7)

- GHC 7.10 compatibility (#239)

- fix the add form when there are included files (#234)

    NB to make this work, the add form now shows the full file path of
    the main and included journal files.

- improve add form validation (#223, #234)
    
    All add form errors are displayed as form errors, not internal
    server errors, and when there are errors the add form is redisplayed
    (form inputs are not preserved, currently).

- keep the add button right-aligned when pressing ctrl - on the add form
