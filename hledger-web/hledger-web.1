.SH NAME
.PP
hledger-web - web interface for the hledger accounting tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]hledger-web [OPTIONS]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]hledger web -- [OPTIONS]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hledger is a cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable
file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1).
.PP
hledger-web is hledger\[aq]s web interface.
It starts a simple web application for browsing and adding transactions,
and optionally opens it in a web browser window if possible.
It provides a more user-friendly UI than the hledger CLI or hledger-ui
interface, showing more at once (accounts, the current account register,
balance charts) and allowing history-aware data entry, interactive
searching, and bookmarking.
.PP
hledger-web also lets you share a ledger with multiple users, or even
the public web.
There is no access control, so if you need that you should put it behind
a suitable web proxy.
As a small protection against data loss when running an unprotected
instance, it writes a numbered backup of the main journal file (only ?)
on every edit.
.PP
Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]-f\f[R], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[R], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[R]).
For more about this see hledger(1), hledger_journal(5) etc.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Command-line options and arguments may be used to set an initial filter
on the data.
These filter options are not shown in the web UI, but it will be applied
in addition to any search query entered there.
.PP
Note: if invoking hledger-web as a hledger subcommand, write
\f[C]--\f[R] before options, as shown in the synopsis above.
.TP
.B \f[C]--serve\f[R]
serve and log requests, don\[aq]t browse or auto-exit
.TP
.B \f[C]--serve-api\f[R]
like --serve, but serve only the JSON web API, without the server-side
web UI
.TP
.B \f[C]--host=IPADDR\f[R]

You would change this when sharing over the network, or integrating
within a larger website.
.TP
.B \f[C]--file-url=URL\f[R]
set the static files url (default: BASEURL/static).
hledger-web normally serves static files itself, but if you wanted to
serve them from another server for efficiency, you would set the url
with this.

enable the view, add, and/or manage capabilities (default: view,add)
.TP
.B \f[C]--capabilities-header=HTTPHEADER\f[R]

X-Sandstorm-Permissions (default: disabled)
.PP
hledger input options:
.TP
.B \f[C]-f FILE --file=FILE\f[R]
use a different input file.
For stdin, use - (default: \f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[R] or
\f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R])
.TP
.B \f[C]--rules-file=RULESFILE\f[R]
Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)
.TP
.B \f[C]--separator=CHAR\f[R]

hide/aggregate accounts or postings more than NUM levels deep
.TP
.B \f[C]-E --empty\f[R]
show items with zero amount, normally hidden (and vice-versa in
hledger-ui/hledger-web)
.TP
.B \f[C]-B --cost\f[R]
convert amounts to their cost at transaction time (using the transaction
price, if any)
.TP

.PP
When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line, the
last one takes precedence.
.PP
Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.
.PP
hledger help options:
.TP
.B \f[C]-h --help\f[R]
show general usage (or after COMMAND, command usage)
.TP
.B \f[C]--version\f[R]
show version
.TP
.B \f[C]--debug[=N]\f[R]
show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)
.PP
A \[at]FILE argument will be expanded to the contents of FILE, which
should contain one command line option/argument per line.
(To prevent this, insert a \f[C]--\f[R] argument before.)
.PP
By default, hledger-web starts the web app in \[dq]transient mode\[dq]
and also opens it in your default web browser if possible.
In this mode the web app will keep running for as long as you have it
open in a browser window, and will exit after two minutes of inactivity
(no requests and no browser windows viewing it).
With \f[C]--serve\f[R], it just runs the web app without exiting, and
logs requests to the console.
With \f[C]--serve-api\f[R], only the JSON web api (see below) is served,
with the usual HTML server-side web UI disabled.
.PP
By default the server listens on IP address 127.0.0.1, accessible only
to local requests.
You can use \f[C]--host\f[R] to change this, eg \f[C]--host 0.0.0.0\f[R]
to listen on all configured addresses.
.PP
Similarly, use \f[C]--port\f[R] to set a TCP port other than 5000, eg if
you are running multiple hledger-web instances.
.PP
You can use \f[C]--base-url\f[R] to change the protocol, hostname, port
and path that appear in hyperlinks, useful eg for integrating
hledger-web within a larger website.
The default is \f[C]http://HOST:PORT/\f[R] using the server\[aq]s
configured host address and TCP port (or \f[C]http://HOST\f[R] if PORT
is 80).
.PP
With \f[C]--file-url\f[R] you can set a different base url for static
files, eg for better caching or cookie-less serving on high performance
websites.
.SH PERMISSIONS
.PP
By default, hledger-web allows anyone who can reach it to view the
journal and to add new transactions, but not to change existing data.
.PP
You can restrict who can reach it by
.IP \[bu] 2
setting the IP address it listens on (see \f[C]--host\f[R] above).
By default it listens on 127.0.0.1, accessible to all users on the local
machine.
.IP \[bu] 2
putting it behind an authenticating proxy, using eg apache or nginx
.IP \[bu] 2
custom firewall rules
.PP
You can restrict what the users who reach it can do, by
.IP \[bu] 2
using the \f[C]--capabilities=CAP[,CAP..]\f[R] flag when you start it,
enabling one or more of the following capabilities.
The default value is \f[C]view,add\f[R]:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]view\f[R] - allows viewing the journal file and all included files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]add\f[R] - allows adding new transactions to the main journal file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]manage\f[R] - allows editing, uploading or downloading the main or
included files
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
using the \f[C]--capabilities-header=HTTPHEADER\f[R] flag to specify a
HTTP header from which it will read capabilities to enable.
hledger-web on Sandstorm uses the X-Sandstorm-Permissions header to
integrate with Sandstorm\[aq]s permissions.
This is disabled by default.
.SH EDITING, UPLOADING, DOWNLOADING
.PP
If you enable the \f[C]manage\f[R] capability mentioned above,
you\[aq]ll see a new \[dq]spanner\[dq] button to the right of the search
form.
Clicking this will let you edit, upload, or download the journal file or
any files it includes.
.PP
Note, unlike any other hledger command, in this mode you (or any
visitor) can alter or wipe the data files.
.PP
Normally whenever a file is changed in this way, hledger-web saves a
numbered backup (assuming file permissions allow it, the disk is not
full, etc.) hledger-web is not aware of version control systems,
currently; if you use one, you\[aq]ll have to arrange to commit the
changes yourself (eg with a cron job or a file watcher like entr).
.PP
Changes which would leave the journal file(s) unparseable or non-valid
(eg with failing balance assertions) are prevented.
(Probably.
This needs re-testing.)
.SH RELOADING
.PP
hledger-web detects changes made to the files by other means (eg if you
edit it directly, outside of hledger-web), and it will show the new data
when you reload the page or navigate to a new page.
If a change makes a file unparseable, hledger-web will display an error
message until the file has been fixed.
.PP
(Note: if you are viewing files mounted from another machine, make sure
that both machine clocks are roughly in step.)
.SH JSON API
.PP
In addition to the web UI, hledger-web provides some API routes that
serve JSON in response to GET requests.
(And when started with \f[C]--serve-api\f[R], it provides only these
routes.):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/accountnames
/transactions
/prices
/commodities
/accounts
/accounttransactions/#AccountName
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Also, you can append a new transaction to the journal by sending a PUT
request to \f[C]/add\f[R] (hledger-web only).
As with the web UI\[aq]s add form, hledger-web must be started with the
\f[C]add\f[R] capability for this (enabled by default).
.PP
The payload should be a valid hledger transaction as JSON, similar to
what you get from \f[C]/transactions\f[R] or
\f[C]/accounttransactions\f[R].
.PP
Another way to generate test data is with the
\f[C]readJsonFile\f[R]/\f[C]writeJsonFile\f[R] helpers in
Hledger.Web.Json, which read or write any of hledger\[aq]s JSON-capable
types from or to a file.
Eg here we write the first transaction of a sample journal:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ make ghci-web
>>> :m +*Hledger.Web.Json
>>> writeJsonFile \[dq]txn.json\[dq] (head $ jtxns samplejournal)
>>> :q
$ python -m json.tool <txn.json >txn.pretty.json  # optional: make human-readable
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
(sample output & discussion)
.PP
And here\[aq]s how to test adding that with curl:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/add -X PUT -H \[aq]Content-Type: application/json\[aq] --data-binary \[at]txn.pretty.json; echo
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
By default, both the server-side HTML UI and the JSON API are served.
Running with \f[C]--serve-api\f[R] disables the former, useful if you
only want to serve the API.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] The journal file path when not specified with
\f[C]-f\f[R].
Default: \f[C]\[ti]/.hledger.journal\f[R] (on windows, perhaps
\f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[R]).
.SH FILES
.PP
Reads data from one or more files in hledger journal, timeclock,
timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]-f\f[R], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[R], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[R]).
.SH BUGS
.PP
The need to precede options with \f[C]--\f[R] when invoked from hledger
is awkward.
.PP
\f[C]-f-\f[R] doesn\[aq]t work (hledger-web can\[aq]t read from stdin).
.PP
Query arguments and some hledger options are ignored.
.PP
Does not work in text-mode browsers.
.PP
Does not work well on small screens.
