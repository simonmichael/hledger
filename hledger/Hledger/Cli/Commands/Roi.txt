roi
Shows the time-weighted (TWR) and money-weighted (IRR) rate of return on
your investments.

_FLAGS_

This command assumes that you have account(s) that hold nothing but your
investments and whenever you record current appraisal/valuation of these
investments you offset unrealized profit and loss into account(s) that,
again, hold nothing but unrealized profit and loss.

Any transactions affecting balance of investment account(s) and not
originating from unrealized profit and loss account(s) are assumed to be
your investments or withdrawals.

At a minimum, you need to supply a query (which could be just an account
name) to select your investments with --inv, and another query to
identify your profit and loss transactions with --pnl.

It will compute and display the internalized rate of return (IRR) and
time-weighted rate of return (TWR) for your investments for the time
period requested. Both rates of return are annualized before display,
regardless of the length of reporting interval.
