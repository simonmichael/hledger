This command displays an income statement, showing revenues and expenses
during one or more periods.

It shows accounts declared with the Revenue or Expense type (see account
types). Or if no such accounts are declared, it shows top-level accounts
named revenue or income or expense (case insensitive, plurals allowed)
and their subaccounts.

Example:

$ hledger incomestatement
Income Statement 2008

                   || 2008 
===================++======
 Revenues          ||      
-------------------++------
 income:gifts      ||   $1 
 income:salary     ||   $1 
-------------------++------
                   ||   $2 
===================++======
 Expenses          ||      
-------------------++------
 expenses:food     ||   $1 
 expenses:supplies ||   $1 
-------------------++------
                   ||   $2 
===================++======
 Net:              ||    0 

This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and
supports many of that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
It is similar to hledger balance '(revenues|income)' expenses, but with
smarter account detection, and revenues/income displayed with their sign
flipped.

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv (Added in 1.32),
html, and json.
