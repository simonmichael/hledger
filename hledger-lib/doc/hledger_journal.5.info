hledger_journal(5)
******************

hledger's usual data source is a plain text file containing journal
entries in hledger journal format. This file represents a standard
accounting general journal. I use file names ending in `.journal', but
that's not required. The journal file contains a number of transaction
entries, each describing a transfer of money (or any commodity) between
two or more named accounts, in a simple format readable by both hledger
and humans.

   hledger's journal format is a compatible subset, mostly, of ledger's
journal format, so hledger can work with compatible ledger journal files
as well. It's safe, and encouraged, to run both hledger and ledger on
the same journal file, eg to validate the results you're getting.

   You can use hledger without learning any more about this file; just
use the add or web commands to create and update it. Many users, though,
also edit the journal file directly with a text editor, perhaps assisted
by the helper modes for emacs or vim.

   Here's an example:


; A sample journal file. This is a comment.

2008/01/01 income               ; <- transaction's first line starts in column 0, contains date and description
    assets:bank:checking  $1    ; <- posting lines start with whitespace, each contains an account name
    income:salary        $-1    ;    followed by at least two spaces and an amount

2008/06/01 gift
    assets:bank:checking  $1    ; <- at least two postings in a transaction
    income:gifts         $-1    ; <- their amounts must balance to 0

2008/06/02 save
    assets:bank:saving    $1
    assets:bank:checking        ; <- one amount may be omitted; here $-1 is inferred

2008/06/03 eat & shop           ; <- description can be anything
    expenses:food         $1
    expenses:supplies     $1    ; <- this transaction debits two expense accounts
    assets:cash                 ; <- $-2 inferred

2008/12/31 * pay off            ; <- an optional * or ! after the date means "cleared" (or anything you want)
    liabilities:debts     $1

1.1 Transactions
================

Transactions are represented by journal entries. Each begins with a
simple date in column 0, followed by three optional fields with spaces
between them:

   * a status flag, which can be empty or `!' or `*' (meaning
     "uncleared", "pending" and "cleared", or whatever you want)

   * a transaction code (eg a check number),

   * and/or a description

   then some number of postings, of some amount to some account, each on
its own line. Usually there are at least two postings, though one or
even none is possible.

   The (real) posting amounts within a transaction must always balance,
ie add up to 0. Optionally one amount can be left blank, in which case
it will be inferred.

1.2.1 Simple dates
------------------

Within a journal file, transaction dates use Y/M/D (or Y-M-D or Y.M.D)
Leading zeros are optional. The year may be omitted, in which case it
will be inferred from the context - the current transaction, the default
year set with a default year directive, or the current date when the
command is run. Some examples: `2010/01/31', `1/31', `2010-01-31',
`2010.1.31'.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Secondary dates,  Next: Posting dates,  Prev: Simple dates,  Up: Dates

1.2.2 Secondary dates
---------------------

Real-life transactions sometimes involve more than one date - eg the
date you write a cheque, and the date it clears in your bank. When you
want to model this, eg for more accurate balances, you can specify
individual #posting-dates, which I recommend. Or, you can use the
secondary dates (aka auxiliary/effective dates) feature, supported for
compatibility with Ledger.

   A secondary date can be written after the primary date, separated by
an equals sign. The primary date, on the left, is used by default; the
secondary date, on the right, is used when the `--date2' flag is
specified (`--aux-date' or `--effective' also work).

   The meaning of secondary dates is up to you, but it's best to follow
a consistent rule. Eg write the bank's clearing date as primary, and
when needed, the date the transaction was initiated as secondary.

   Here's an example. Note that a secondary date will use the year of
the primary date if unspecified.


2010/2/23=2/19 movie ticket
  expenses:cinema                   $10
  assets:checking


$ hledger register checking
2010/02/23 movie ticket         assets:checking                $-10         $-10


$ hledger register checking --date2
2010/02/19 movie ticket         assets:checking                $-10         $-10

   Secondary dates require some effort; you must use them consistently
in your journal entries and remember whether to use or not use the
`--date2' flag for your reports. They are included in hledger for
Ledger compatibility, but posting dates are a more powerful and less
confusing alternative.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Posting dates,  Prev: Secondary dates,  Up: Dates

1.2.3 Posting dates
-------------------

You can give individual postings a different date from their parent
transaction, by adding a posting comment containing a tag (see below)
like `date:DATE'. This is probably the best way to control posting
dates precisely. Eg in this example the expense should appear in May
reports, and the deduction from checking should be reported on 6/1 for
easy bank reconciliation:


2015/5/30
    expenses:food     $10   ; food purchased on saturday 5/30
    assets:checking         ; bank cleared it on monday, date:6/1


$ hledger -f t.j register food
2015/05/30                      expenses:food                  $10           $10


$ hledger -f t.j register checking
2015/06/01                      assets:checking               $-10          $-10

   DATE should be a simple date; if the year is not specified it will
use the year of the transaction's date. You can set the secondary date
similarly, with `date2:DATE2'. The `date:' or `date2:' tags must have a
valid simple date value if they are present, eg a `date:' tag with no
value is not allowed.

   Ledger's earlier, more compact bracketed date syntax is also
supported: `[DATE]', `[DATE=DATE2]' or `[=DATE2]'. hledger will attempt
to parse any square-bracketed sequence of the `0123456789/-.='
characters in this way. With this syntax, DATE infers its year from the
transaction and DATE2 infers its year from DATE.

1.3 Account names
=================

Account names typically have several parts separated by a full colon,
from which hledger derives a hierarchical chart of accounts. They can be
anything you like, but in finance there are traditionally five top-level
accounts: `assets', `liabilities', `income', `expenses', and `equity'.

   Account names may contain single spaces, eg: `assets:accounts
receivable'. Because of this, they must always be followed by *two or
more spaces* (or newline).

   Account names can be aliased.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Amounts,  Next: Virtual Postings,  Prev: Account names,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.4 Amounts
===========

After the account name, there is usually an amount. Important: between
account name and amount, there must be *two or more spaces*.

   Amounts consist of a number and (usually) a currency symbol or
commodity name. Some examples:

   `2.00001'
`$1'
`4000 AAPL'
`3 "green apples"'
`-$1,000,000.00'
`INR 9,99,99,999.00'
`EUR -2.000.000,00'

   As you can see, the amount format is somewhat flexible:

   * amounts are a number (the "quantity") and optionally a currency
     symbol/commodity name (the "commodity").

   * the commodity is a symbol, word, or double-quoted phrase, on the
     left or right, with or without a separating space

   * negative amounts with a commodity on the left can have the minus
     sign before or after it

   * digit groups (thousands, or any other grouping) can be separated by
     commas (in which case period is used for decimal point) or periods
     (in which case comma is used for decimal point)

   You can use any of these variations when recording data, but when
hledger displays amounts, it will choose a consistent format for each
commodity. (Except for price amounts, which are always formatted as
written). The display format is chosen as follows:

   * if there is a commodity directive specifying the format, that is
     used

   * otherwise the format is inferred from the first posting amount in
     that commodity in the journal, and the precision (number of
     decimal places) will be the maximum from all posting amounts in
     that commmodity

   * or if there are no such amounts in the journal, a default format
     is used (like `$1000.00').

   Price amounts and amounts in D directives usually don't affect amount
format inference, but in some situations they can do so indirectly. (Eg
when D's default commodity is applied to a commodity-less amount, or
when an amountless posting is balanced using a price's commodity, or
when -V is used.) If you find this causing problems, set the desired
format with a commodity directive.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Virtual Postings,  Next: Balance Assertions,  Prev: Amounts,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.5 Virtual Postings
====================

When you parenthesise the account name in a posting, we call that a
_virtual posting_, which means:

   * it is ignored when checking that the transaction is balanced

   * it is excluded from reports when the `--real/-R' flag is used, or
     the `real:1' query.

   You could use this, eg, to set an account's opening balance without
needing to use the `equity:opening balances' account:


1/1 special unbalanced posting to set initial balance
  (assets:checking)   $1000

   When the account name is bracketed, we call it a _balanced virtual
posting_. This is like an ordinary virtual posting except the balanced
virtual postings in a transaction must balance to 0, like the real
postings (but separately from them). Balanced virtual postings are also
excluded by `--real/-R' or `real:1'.


1/1 buy food with cash, and update some budget-tracking subaccounts elsewhere
  expenses:food                   $10
  assets:cash                    $-10
  [assets:checking:available]     $10
  [assets:checking:budget:food]  $-10

   Virtual postings have some legitimate uses, but those are few. You
can usually find an equivalent journal entry using real postings, which
is more correct and provides better error checking.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Balance Assertions,  Next: Prices,  Prev: Virtual Postings,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.6 Balance Assertions
======================

hledger supports ledger-style balance assertions in journal files. These
look like `=EXPECTEDBALANCE' following a posting's amount. Eg in this
example we assert the expected dollar balance in accounts a and b after
each posting:


2013/1/1
  a   $1  =$1
  b       =$-1

2013/1/2
  a   $1  =$2
  b  $-1  =$-2

   After reading a journal file, hledger will check all balance
assertions and report an error if any of them fail. Balance assertions
can protect you from, eg, inadvertently disrupting reconciled balances
while cleaning up old entries. You can disable them temporarily with the
`--ignore-assertions' flag, which can be useful for troubleshooting or
for reading Ledger files.

* Assertions and virtual postings::


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Assertions and ordering,  Next: Assertions and commodities,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.6.1 Assertions and ordering
-----------------------------

hledger sorts an account's postings and assertions first by date and
then (for postings on the same day) by parse order. Note this is
different from Ledger, which sorts assertions only by parse order.
(Also, Ledger assertions do not see the accumulated effect of repeated
postings to the same account within a transaction.)

   So, hledger balance assertions keep working if you reorder
differently-dated transactions within the journal. But if you reorder
same-dated transactions or postings, assertions might break and require
updating. This order dependence does bring an advantage: precise control
over the order of postings and assertions within a day, so you can
assert intra-day balances.

   With included files, things are a little more complicated. Including
preserves the ordering of postings and assertions. If you have multiple
postings to an account on the same day, split across different files,
and you also want to assert the account's balance on the same day,
you'll have to put the assertion in the right file.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Assertions and commodities,  Next: Assertions and subaccounts,  Prev: Assertions and ordering,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.6.2 Assertions and commodities
--------------------------------

The asserted balance must be a simple single-commodity amount, and in
fact the assertion checks only this commodity's balance within the
(possibly multi-commodity) account balance. We could call this a partial
balance assertion. This is compatible with Ledger, and makes it possible
to make assertions about accounts containing multiple commodities.

   To assert each commodity's balance in such a multi-commodity account,
you can add multiple postings (with amount 0 if necessary). But note
that no matter how many assertions you add, you can't be sure the
account does not contain some unexpected commodity. (We'll add support
for this kind of total balance assertion if there's demand.)


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Assertions and subaccounts,  Next: Assertions and virtual postings,  Prev: Assertions and commodities,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.6.3 Assertions and subaccounts
--------------------------------

Balance assertions do not count the balance from subaccounts; they check
the posted account's exclusive balance. For example:


1/1
  checking:fund   1 = 1  ; post to this subaccount, its balance is now 1
  checking        1 = 1  ; post to the parent account, its exclusive balance is now 1
  equity

   The balance report's flat mode shows these exclusive balances more
clearly:


$ hledger bal checking --flat
                   1  checking
                   1  checking:fund
--------------------
                   2


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Assertions and virtual postings,  Prev: Assertions and subaccounts,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.6.4 Assertions and virtual postings
-------------------------------------

Balance assertions are checked against all postings, both real and
virtual. They are not affected by the `--real/-R' flag or `real:' query.

File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Transaction prices,  Next: Market prices,  Up: Prices

1.7.1 Transaction prices
------------------------

When recording a transaction, you can also record an amount's price in
another commodity. This documents the exchange rate, cost (of a
purchase), or selling price (of a sale) that was in effect within this
particular transaction (or more precisely, within the particular
posting). These transaction prices are fixed, and do not change.

   Such priced amounts can be displayed in their transaction price's
commodity, by using the `--cost/-B' flag (B for "cost Basis"),
supported by most hledger commands.

   There are three ways to specify a transaction price:

  1. Write the unit price (aka exchange rate), as `@ UNITPRICE' after
     the amount:


     2009/1/1
       assets:foreign currency   €100 @ $1.35  ; one hundred euros at $1.35 each
       assets:cash

  2. Or write the total price, as `@@ TOTALPRICE' after the amount:


     2009/1/1
       assets:foreign currency   €100 @@ $135  ; one hundred euros at $135 for the lot
       assets:cash

  3. Or let hledger infer the price so as to balance the transaction. To
     permit this, you must fully specify all posting amounts, and their
     sum must have a non-zero amount in exactly two commodities:


     2009/1/1
       assets:foreign currency   €100          ; one hundred euros
       assets:cash              $-135          ; exchanged for $135


   With any of the above examples we get:


$ hledger print -B
2009/01/01
    assets:foreign currency       $135.00
    assets:cash                  $-135.00

   Example use for transaction prices: recording the effective
conversion rate of purchases made in a foreign currency.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Market prices,  Prev: Transaction prices,  Up: Prices

1.7.2 Market prices
-------------------

Market prices are not tied to a particular transaction; they represent
historical exchange rates between two commodities, usually from some
public market which publishes such rates.

   When market prices are known, the `-V/--value' option will use them
to convert reported amounts to their market value as of the report end
date. This option is currently available only with the balance command.

   You record market prices (Ledger calls them historical prices) with
a P directive, in the journal or perhaps in a separate included file.
Market price directives have the format:


P DATE COMMODITYSYMBOL UNITPRICE

   For example, the following directives say that the euro's exchange
rate was 1.35 US dollars during 2009, and $1.40 from 2010 onward (and
unknown before 2009).


P 2009/1/1 € $1.35
P 2010/1/1 € $1.40

   Example use for market prices: tracking the value of stocks.


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Tags,  Prev: Prices,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.8 Comments
============

Lines in the journal beginning with a semicolon (`;') or hash (`#') or
asterisk (`*') are comments, and will be ignored.  (Asterisk comments
make it easy to treat your journal like an org-mode outline in emacs.)

   Also, anything between `comment' and `end comment' directives is a
(multi-line) comment. If there is no `end comment', the comment extends
to the end of the file.

   You can attach comments to a transaction by writing them after the
description and/or indented on the following lines (before the
postings). Similarly, you can attach comments to an individual posting
by writing them after the amount and/or indented on the following lines.

   Some examples:


# a journal comment

; also a journal comment

comment
This is a multiline comment,
which continues until a line
where the "end comment" string
appears on its own.
end comment

2012/5/14 something  ; a transaction comment
    ; the transaction comment, continued
    posting1  1  ; a comment for posting 1
    posting2
    ; a comment for posting 2
    ; another comment line for posting 2
; a journal comment (because not indented)


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Tags,  Next: Directives,  Prev: Comments,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.9 Tags
========

A _tag_ is a word followed by a full colon inside a transaction or
posting comment. You can write multiple tags, comma separated. Eg: `; a
comment containing sometag:, anothertag:'. You can search for tags with
the `tag:' query.

   A tag can also have a value, which is any text between the colon and
the next comma or newline, excluding leading/trailing whitespace. (So
hledger tag values can not contain commas or newlines).

   Tags in a transaction comment affect the transaction and all of its
postings, while tags in a posting comment affect only that posting. For
example, the following transaction has three tags (A, TAG2, third-tag)
and the posting has four (A, TAG2, third-tag, posting-tag):


1/1 a transaction  ; A:, TAG2:
    ; third-tag: a third transaction tag, this time with a value
    (a)  $1  ; posting-tag:

   Tags are like Ledger's metadata feature, except hledger's tag values
are simple strings.

1.10.1 Account aliases
----------------------

You can define aliases which rewrite your account names (after reading
the journal, before generating reports). hledger's account aliases can
be useful for:

   * expanding shorthand account names to their full form, allowing
     easier data entry and a less verbose journal

   * adapting old journals to your current chart of accounts

   * experimenting with new account organisations, like a new hierarchy
     or combining two accounts into one

   * customising reports

   See also How to use account aliases.

File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Basic aliases,  Next: Regex aliases,  Up: Account aliases

1.10.1.1 Basic aliases
......................

To set an account alias, use the `alias' directive in your journal
file. This affects all subsequent journal entries in the current file or
its included files. The spaces around the = are optional:


alias OLD = NEW

   Or, you can use the `--alias 'OLD=NEW'' option on the command line.
This affects all entries. It's useful for trying out aliases
interactively.

   OLD and NEW are full account names. hledger will replace any
occurrence of the old account name with the new one. Subaccounts are
also affected.  Eg:


alias checking = assets:bank:wells fargo:checking
# rewrites "checking" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking", or "checking:a" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking:a"


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Regex aliases,  Next: Multiple aliases,  Prev: Basic aliases,  Up: Account aliases

1.10.1.2 Regex aliases
......................

There is also a more powerful variant that uses a regular expression,
indicated by the forward slashes. (This was the default behaviour in
hledger 0.24-0.25):


alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT

   or `--alias '/REGEX/=REPLACEMENT''.

   REGEX is a case-insensitive regular expression. Anywhere it matches
inside an account name, the matched part will be replaced by
REPLACEMENT. If REGEX contains parenthesised match groups, these can be
referenced by the usual numeric backreferences in REPLACEMENT. Note,
currently regular expression aliases may cause noticeable slow-downs.
(And if you use Ledger on your hledger file, they will be ignored.) Eg:


alias /^(.+):bank:([^:]+)(.*)/ = \1:\2 \3
# rewrites "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking" to  "assets:wells fargo checking"


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: Multiple aliases,  Next: end aliases,  Prev: Regex aliases,  Up: Account aliases

1.10.1.3 Multiple aliases
.........................

You can define as many aliases as you like using directives or
command-line options. Aliases are recursive - each alias sees the result
of applying previous ones. (This is different from Ledger, where aliases
are non-recursive by default). Aliases are applied in the following
order:

  1. alias directives, most recently seen first (recent directives take
     precedence over earlier ones; directives not yet seen are ignored)

  2. alias options, in the order they appear on the command line


File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: end aliases,  Prev: Multiple aliases,  Up: Account aliases

1.10.2 account directive
------------------------

The `account' directive predefines account names, as in Ledger and
Beancount. This may be useful for your own documentation; hledger
doesn't make use of it yet.

File: hledger_journal.5.info,  Node: apply account directive,  Next: Multi-line comments,  Prev: account directive,  Up: Directives

1.10.3 apply account directive
------------------------------

You can specify a parent account which will be prepended to all accounts
within a section of the journal. Use the `apply account' and `end apply
account' directives like so:


apply account home

2010/1/1
    food    $10
    cash

end apply account

   which is equivalent to:


2010/01/01
    home:food           $10
    home:cash          $-10

   If `end apply account' is omitted, the effect lasts to the end of
the file. Included files are also affected, eg:


apply account business
include biz.journal
end apply account
apply account personal
include personal.journal

   Prior to hledger 0.28, legacy `account' and `end' spellings were
also supported.

just informational), and also it may define the display format for
amounts in this commodity (overriding the automatically inferred
format).

   It may be written on a single line, like this:


; commodity EXAMPLEAMOUNT

; display AAAA amounts with the symbol on the right, space-separated,
; using period as decimal point, with four decimal places, and
; separating thousands with comma.
commodity 1,000.0000 AAAA

   or on multiple lines, using the "format" subdirective. In this case
the commodity symbol appears twice and should be the same in both
places:


; commodity SYMBOL
;   format EXAMPLEAMOUNT

; display indian rupees with currency name on the left,
; thousands, lakhs and crores comma-separated,
; period as decimal point, and two decimal places.
commodity INR
  format INR 9,99,99,999.00

1.10.6 Default commodity
------------------------

You can set a default commodity, to be used for amounts without one. Use
the D directive with a sample amount. The commodity (and the sample
amount's display format) will be applied to all subsequent
commodity-less amounts, up to the next D directive. (Note this is
different from Ledger's default commodity directive.)

1.10.7 Default year
-------------------

You can set a default year to be used for subsequent dates which don't
specify a year. This is a line beginning with `Y' followed by the year.
Eg:


Y2009      ; set default year to 2009

12/15      ; equivalent to 2009/12/15
  expenses  1
  assets

Y2010      ; change default year to 2010

2009/1/30  ; specifies the year, not affected
  expenses  1
  assets

1/31       ; equivalent to 2010/1/31
  expenses  1
  assets

1.10.8 Including other files
----------------------------

You can pull in the content of additional journal files by writing an
include directive, like this:


include path/to/file.journal

   If the path does not begin with a slash, it is relative to the
current file. Glob patterns (`*') are not currently supported.

   The `include' directive can only be used in journal files. It can
include journal, timeclock or timedot files, but not CSV files.

2 EDITOR SUPPORT
****************

Add-on modes exist for various text editors, to make working with
journal files easier. They add colour, navigation aids and helpful
commands. For hledger users who edit the journal file directly (the
majority), using one of these modes is quite recommended.

   These were written with Ledger in mind, but also work with hledger
files:
