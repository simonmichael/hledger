.SH DESCRIPTION
hledger is a robust, user\-friendly, cross\-platform set of programs for
tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double\-entry
accounting and a simple, editable file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1), and
largely interconvertible with beancount(1).
.PP
This manual is for hledger\[aq]s command line interface, version
1.40.99.
It also describes the common options, file formats and concepts used by
all hledger programs.
It might accidentally teach you some bookkeeping/accounting as well!
You don\[aq]t need to know everything in here to use hledger
productively, but when you have a question about functionality, this doc
should answer it.
It is detailed, so do skip ahead or skim when needed.
You can read it on hledger.org, or as an info manual or man page on your
system.
You can also open a built\-in copy, at a point of interest, by running

.PD
\f[CR]hledger \-\-man [CMD]\f[R], \f[CR]hledger \-\-info [CMD]\f[R] or
\f[CR]hledger help [TOPIC]\f[R].
.PP
(And for shorter help, try \f[CR]hledger \-\-tldr [CMD]\f[R].)
.PP
The main function of the hledger CLI is to read plain text files
describing financial transactions, crunch the numbers, and print a
useful report on the terminal (or save it as HTML, CSV, JSON or SQL).
Many reports are available, as subcommands.
hledger will also detect other \f[CR]hledger\-*\f[R] executables as
extra subcommands.
.PP
hledger usually reads from (and appends to) a journal file specified by
the \f[CR]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] environment variable (defaulting to
\f[CR]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R]); or you can specify files with
\f[CR]\-f\f[R] options.
It can also read timeclock files, timedot files, or any CSV/SSV/TSV file
with a date field.
.PP
Here is a small journal file describing one transaction:
.IP
.EX
2015\-10\-16 bought food
  expenses:food          $10
  assets:cash
.EE
.PP
Transactions are dated movements of money (etc.)
between two or more \f[I]accounts\f[R]: bank accounts, your wallet,
revenue/expense categories, people, etc.
You can choose any account names you wish, using \f[CR]:\f[R] to
indicate subaccounts.
There must be at least two spaces between account name and amount.
Positive amounts are inflow to that account (\f[I]debit\f[R]), negatives
are outflow from it (\f[I]credit\f[R]).
(Some reports show revenue, liability and equity account balances as
negative numbers as a result; this is normal.)
.PP
hledger\[cq]s add command can help you add transactions, or you can
install other data entry UIs like hledger\-web or hledger\-iadd.
For more extensive/efficient changes, use a text editor: Emacs +
ledger\-mode, VIM + vim\-ledger, or VS Code + hledger\-vscode are some
good choices (see https://hledger.org/editors.html).
.PP
To get started, run \f[CR]hledger add\f[R] and follow the prompts, or
save some entries like the above in \f[CR]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R],
then try commands like:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-x
$ hledger aregister assets
$ hledger balance
$ hledger balancesheet
$ hledger incomestatement
.EE
.PP
Run \f[CR]hledger\f[R] to list the commands.
See also the \[dq]Starting a journal file\[dq] and \[dq]Setting opening
balances\[dq] sections in PART 5: COMMON TASKS.
.SH PART 1: USER INTERFACE
.SH Input
hledger reads one or more data files, each time you run it.
You can specify a file with \f[CR]\-f\f[R], like so
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f FILE [\-f FILE2 ...] print
.EE
.PP
Files are most often in hledger\[aq]s journal format, with the
\f[CR].journal\f[R] file extension (\f[CR].hledger\f[R] or \f[CR].j\f[R]
also work); these files describe transactions, like an accounting
general journal.
.PP
When no file is specified, hledger looks for \f[CR].hledger.journal\f[R]
in your home directory.
.PP
But most people prefer to keep financial files in a dedicated folder,
perhaps with version control.
Also, starting a new journal file each year is common (it\[aq]s not
required, but helps keep things fast and organised).
So we usually configure a different journal file, by setting the
\f[CR]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] environment variable, to something like
\f[CR]\[ti]/finance/2023.journal\f[R].
For more about how to do that on your system, see Common tasks > Setting
LEDGER_FILE.
.SS Text encoding
Data files containing non\-ascii characters must use UTF\-8 encoding.
An optional byte order mark (BOM) is allowed, at the beginning of the
file (only).
.PP
Also, your system should be configured with a locale that can decode
UTF\-8 text.
On some unix systems, you may need set the \f[CR]LANG\f[R] environment
variable, eg.
You can read more about this in Unicode characters, below.
.PP
On unix systems you can check a file\[aq]s encoding with the
\f[CR]file\f[R] command.
If you need to import from a UTF\-16\-encoded CSV file, say, you can
convert it to UTF\-8 with the \f[CR]iconv\f[R] command.
.SS Data formats
Usually the data file is in hledger\[aq]s journal format, but it can be
in any of the supported file formats, which currently are:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
lw(13.5n) lw(33.0n) lw(23.5n).

.TE
.PP
These formats are described in more detail below.
.PP
hledger detects the format automatically based on the file extensions
shown above.
If it can\[aq]t recognise the file extension, it assumes
\f[CR]journal\f[R] format.
So for non\-journal files, it\[aq]s important to use a recognised file
extension, so as to either read successfully or to show relevant error
messages.
.PP
You can also force a specific reader/format by prefixing the file path
with the format and a colon.
Eg, to read a .dat file containing tab separated values:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f tsv:/some/file.dat stats
.EE
.SS Standard input
The file name \f[CR]\-\f[R] means standard input:
.IP
.EX
$ cat FILE | hledger \-f\- print
.EE
.PP
If reading non\-journal data in this way, you\[aq]ll need to write the
format as a prefix, like \f[CR]timeclock:\f[R] here:
.IP
.EX
$ echo \[aq]i 2009/13/1 08:00:00\[aq] | hledger print \-f timeclock:\-
.EE
.SS Multiple files
You can specify multiple \f[CR]\-f\f[R] options, to read multiple files
as one big journal.
When doing this, note that certain features (described below) will be
affected:
.IP \[bu] 2
Balance assertions will not see the effect of transactions in previous
files.
(Usually this doesn\[aq]t matter as each file will set the corresponding
opening balances.)
.IP \[bu] 2
Some directives will not affect previous or subsequent files.
.PP
If needed, you can work around these by using a single parent file which
includes the others, or concatenating the files into one, eg:
\f[CR]cat a.journal b.journal | hledger \-f\- CMD\f[R].
.SS Strict mode
hledger checks input files for valid data.
By default, the most important errors are detected, while still
accepting easy journal files without a lot of declarations:
.IP \[bu] 2
Are the input files parseable, with valid syntax ?
.IP \[bu] 2
Are all transactions balanced ?
.IP \[bu] 2
Do all balance assertions pass ?
.PP
With the \f[CR]\-s\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-strict\f[R] flag, additional checks
are performed:
.IP \[bu] 2
Are all accounts posted to, declared with an \f[CR]account\f[R]
directive ?
(Account error checking)
.IP \[bu] 2
Are all commodities declared with a \f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive ?
(Commodity error checking)
.IP \[bu] 2
Are all commodity conversions declared explicitly ?
.PP
You can use the check command to run individual checks \-\- the ones
listed above and some more.
.SH Commands
hledger provides various subcommands for getting things done.
Most of these commands do not change the journal file; they just read it
and output a report.
A few commands assist with adding data and file management.
.PP
To show a summary of commands, run \f[CR]hledger\f[R] with no arguments.
You can see the same commands summary at the start of PART 4: COMMANDS
below.
.PP
To use a particular command, run
\f[CR]hledger CMD [CMDOPTS] [CMDARGS]\f[R],
.IP \[bu] 2
CMD is the full command name, or its standard abbreviation shown in the
commands list, or any unambiguous prefix of the name.
.IP \[bu] 2
CMDOPTS are command\-specific options, if any.
Command\-specific options must be written after the command name.
Eg: \f[CR]hledger print \-x\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
CMDARGS are additional arguments to the command, if any.
Most hledger commands accept arguments representing a query, to limit
the data in some way.
Eg: \f[CR]hledger reg assets:checking\f[R].
.PP
To list a command\[aq]s options, arguments, and documentation in the
terminal, run \f[CR]hledger CMD \-h\f[R].
Eg: \f[CR]hledger bal \-h\f[R].
.SS Add\-on commands
In addition to the built\-in commands, you can install \f[I]add\-on
commands\f[R]: programs or scripts named \[dq]hledger\-SOMETHING\[dq],
which will also appear in hledger\[aq]s commands list.
If you used the hledger\-install script, you will have several add\-ons
installed already.
Some more can be found in hledger\[aq]s bin/ directory, documented at
https://hledger.org/scripts.html.
.PP
More precisely, add\-on commands are programs or scripts in your
shell\[aq]s PATH, whose name starts with \[dq]hledger\-\[dq] and ends
with no extension or a recognised extension (\[dq].bat\[dq],
\[dq].com\[dq], \[dq].exe\[dq], \[dq].hs\[dq], \[dq].js\[dq],
\[dq].lhs\[dq], \[dq].lua\[dq], \[dq].php\[dq], \[dq].pl\[dq],
\[dq].py\[dq], \[dq].rb\[dq], \[dq].rkt\[dq], or \[dq].sh\[dq]), and (on
unix and mac) which has executable permission for the current user.
.PP
You can run add\-on commands using hledger, much like built\-in
commands:
\f[CR]hledger ADDONCMD [\-\- ADDONCMDOPTS] [ADDONCMDARGS]\f[R].
But note the double hyphen argument, required before add\-on\-specific
options.
Eg: \f[CR]hledger ui \-\- \-\-watch\f[R] or
\f[CR]hledger web \-\- \-\-serve\f[R].
If this causes difficulty, you can always run the add\-on directly,
without using \f[CR]hledger\f[R]: \f[CR]hledger\-ui \-\-watch\f[R] or
\f[CR]hledger\-web \-\-serve\f[R].
.SH Options
Run \f[CR]hledger \-h\f[R] to see general command line help.
Options can be written either before or after the command name.
These options are specific to the \f[CR]hledger\f[R] CLI:
.IP
.EX
Flags:
     \-\-conf=CONFFILE        Use extra options defined in this config file. If
                            not specified, searches upward and in XDG config
                            dir for hledger.conf (or .hledger.conf in $HOME).
  \-n \-\-no\-conf              ignore any config file
.EE
.PP
And the following general options are common to most hledger commands:
.IP
.EX
General input/data transformation flags:
  \-f \-\-file=[FMT:]FILE      Read data from FILE, or from stdin if FILE is \-,
                            inferring format from extension or a FMT: prefix.
                            Can be specified more than once. If not specified,
                            reads from $LEDGER_FILE or $HOME/.hledger.journal.
     \-\-rules=RULESFILE      Use rules defined in this rules file for
                            converting subsequent CSV/SSV/TSV files. If not
                            specified, uses FILE.csv.rules for each FILE.csv.
     \-\-alias=A=B|/RGX/=RPL  transform account names from A to B, or by
                            replacing regular expression matches
     \-\-auto                 generate extra postings by applying auto posting
                            rules (\[dq]=\[dq]) to all transactions
     \-\-forecast[=PERIOD]    Generate extra transactions from periodic rules
                            (\[dq]\[ti]\[dq]), from after the latest ordinary transaction
                            until 6 months from now. Or, during the specified
                            PERIOD (the equals is required). Auto posting rules
                            will also be applied to these transactions. In
                            hledger\-ui, also make future\-dated transactions
                            visible at startup.
  \-I \-\-ignore\-assertions    don\[aq]t check balance assertions by default
     \-\-infer\-costs          infer conversion equity postings from costs
     \-\-infer\-equity         infer costs from conversion equity postings
     \-\-infer\-market\-prices  infer market prices from costs
     \-\-pivot=TAGNAME        use a different field or tag as account names
  \-s \-\-strict               do extra error checks (and override \-I)
     \-\-verbose\-tags         add tags indicating generated/modified data

  \-b \-\-begin=DATE           include postings/transactions on/after this date
  \-e \-\-end=DATE             include postings/transactions before this date
                            (with a report interval, will be adjusted to
                            following subperiod end)

  \-M \-\-monthly              multiperiod report with 1 month interval
  \-Q \-\-quarterly            multiperiod report with 1 quarter interval
  \-Y \-\-yearly               multiperiod report with 1 year interval
  \-p \-\-period=PERIODEXP     set begin date, end date, and/or report interval,
                            with more flexibility
     \-\-today=DATE           override today\[aq]s date (affects relative dates)

  \-C \-\-cleared              include only cleared postings/transactions
                            (\-U/\-P/\-C can be combined)
  \-R \-\-real                 include only non\-virtual postings
     \-\-depth=NUM            or \-NUM: show only top NUM levels of accounts
  \-E \-\-empty                Show zero items, which are normally hidden.
                            In hledger\-ui & hledger\-web, do the opposite.
  \-B \-\-cost                 show amounts converted to their cost/sale amount
  \-V \-\-market               Show amounts converted to their value at period
                            end(s) in their default valuation commodity.
                            Equivalent to \-\-value=end.
  \-X \-\-exchange=COMM        Show amounts converted to their value at period
                            end(s) in the specified commodity.
                            Equivalent to \-\-value=end,COMM.
     \-\-value=WHEN[,COMM]    show amounts converted to their value on the
                            specified date(s) in their default valuation
                            commodity or a specified commodity. WHEN can be:
                            \[aq]then\[aq]:     value on transaction dates
                            \[aq]end\[aq]:      value at period end(s)
                            \[aq]now\[aq]:      value today
                            YYYY\-MM\-DD: value on given date
  \-c \-\-commodity\-style=S    Override a commodity\[aq]s display style.
                            Eg: \-c \[aq].\[aq] or \-c \[aq]1.000,00 EUR\[aq]
     \-\-color=YN \-\-colour    Use ANSI color codes in text output? Can be
                            \[aq]y\[aq]/\[aq]yes\[aq]/\[aq]always\[aq], \[aq]n\[aq]/\[aq]no\[aq]/\[aq]never\[aq] or \[aq]auto\[aq].
     \-\-pretty[=YN]          Use box\-drawing characters in text output? Can be
                            \[aq]y\[aq]/\[aq]yes\[aq] or \[aq]n\[aq]/\[aq]no\[aq].
                            If YN is specified, the equals is required.

General help flags:
  \-h \-\-help                 show command line help
     \-\-tldr                 show command examples with tldr
     \-\-info                 show the manual with info

     \-\-debug=[1\-9]          show this much debug output (default: 1)
.EE
.PP
Usually hledger accepts any unambiguous flag prefix, eg you can write
\f[CR]\-\-tl\f[R] instead of \f[CR]\-\-tldr\f[R] or \f[CR]\-\-dry\f[R]
instead of \f[CR]\-\-dry\-run\f[R].
.PP
If the same option appears more than once in a command, usually the last
(right\-most) wins.
.PP
With most commands, arguments are interpreted as a hledger query which
filter the data.
Some queries can be expressed either with options or with arguments.
.PP
Below are more tips for using the command line interface \- feel free to
skip these until you need them.
.SS Special characters
Here we touch on shell escaping/quoting rules, and give some examples.
This is a slightly complicated topic which you may not need at first,
but you should be aware of it, so you can return here when needed.
.PP
If you are able to minimise the use of special characters in your data,
you won\[aq]t need escaping as much, and your command lines will be
simpler.
For example, avoiding spaces in account names, and using an ISO\-4217
currency code like \f[CR]USD\f[R] instead of the \f[CR]$\f[R] currency
symbol, can be helpful.
.PP
But if you want to use spaced account names and \f[CR]$\f[R], go right
ahead; escaping isn\[aq]t a big deal.
.SS Escaping shell special characters
At the command line, characters which have special meaning for your
shell must be \[dq]shell\-escaped\[dq] (AKA \[dq]quoted\[dq]) if you
want hledger to see them.
Often these include space, \f[CR]<\f[R], \f[CR]>\f[R], \f[CR](\f[R],
\f[CR])\f[R], \f[CR]|\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]\f[R], \f[CR]$\f[R] and/or
\f[CR]%\f[R].
.PP
For example, to match an account name containing the phrase \[dq]credit
card\[dq], don\[aq]t write this:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger register credit card
.EE
.PP
In that command, \[dq]credit\[dq] and \[dq]card\[dq] are treated as
separate query arguments (described below), so this would match accounts
containing either word.
Instead, enclose the phrase in double or single quotes:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger register \[dq]credit card\[dq]
.EE
.PP
In Unix shells, writing a backslash before the character can also work.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger register credit\[rs] card
.EE
.PP
Some shell characters still have a special meaning inside double quotes,
such as the dollar sign (\f[CR]$\f[R]).
Eg in \f[CR]\[dq]assets:$account\[dq]\f[R], the bash shell would replace
\f[CR]$account\f[R] with the value of a shell variable with that name.
When you don\[aq]t want that, use single quotes, which escape more
strongly:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger balance \[aq]assets:$account\[aq]
.EE
.SS Escaping on Windows
If you are using hledger in a Powershell or Command window on Microsoft
Windows, the escaping rules are different:
.IP \[bu] 2
In a Powershell window (\f[CR]powershell\f[R], blue background), you
must use double quotes or single quotes (not backslash).
.IP \[bu] 2
In a Command window (\f[CR]cmd\f[R], black background), you must use
double quotes (not single quotes or backslash).
.PP
The next two sections were written for Unix\-like shells, so might need
to be adapted if you\[aq]re using \f[CR]cmd\f[R] or
\f[CR]powershell\f[R].
(Edits welcome.)
.SS Escaping regular expression special characters
Many hledger arguments are regular expressions (described below), and
these too have characters which cause special effects.
Some of those characters are \f[CR].\f[R], \f[CR]\[ha]\f[R],
\f[CR]$\f[R], \f[CR][\f[R], \f[CR]]\f[R], \f[CR](\f[R], \f[CR])\f[R],
\f[CR]|\f[R], and \f[CR]\[rs]\f[R].
When you don\[aq]t want these to cause special effects, you can
\[dq]regex\-escape\[dq] them by writing \f[CR]\[rs]\f[R] (a backslash)
before them.
But since backslash is also special to the shell, you may need to also
shell\-escape the backslashes.
.PP
Eg, in the bash shell, to match a literal \f[CR]$\f[R] sign, you could
write:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger balance cur:\[rs]\[rs]$
.EE
.PP
or:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger balance \[aq]cur:\[rs]$\[aq]
.EE
.PP
(The dollar sign is regex\-escaped by the backslash preceding it.
Then that backslash is shell\-escaped by another backslash, or by single
quotes.)
.SS Escaping add\-on arguments
When you run an external add\-on command with \f[CR]hledger\f[R]
(described below), any options or arguments being passed through to the
add\-on executable lose one level of shell\-escaping, so you must add an
extra level of shell\-escaping to compensate.
.PP
Eg, in the bash shell, to run the \f[CR]ui\f[R] add\-on and match a
literal \f[CR]$\f[R] sign, you need to write:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger ui cur:\[aq]\[rs]\[rs]$\[aq]
.EE
.PP
or:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger ui cur:\[rs]\[rs]\[rs]\[rs]$
.EE
.PP
If you are wondering why \f[I]four\f[R] backslashes:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]$\f[R] is unescaped
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[rs]$\f[R] is regex\-escaped
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[rs]\[rs]$\f[R] is regex\-escaped, then shell\-escaped
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[rs]\[rs]\[rs]\[rs]$\f[R] is regex\-escaped, then shell\-escaped,
then both slashes are shell\-escaped once more for hledger argument
pass\-through.
.PP
Or you can avoid such triple\-escaping, by running the add\-on
executable directly:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger\-ui cur:\[rs]\[rs]$
.EE
.SS Escaping in other situations
hledger options and arguments are sometimes used in places other than
the command line, with different escaping rules.
For example, backslash\-quoting generally does not work there.
Here are some more tips.

.TE
.SS Using a wild card
When escaping a special character is too much hassle (or impossible),
you can often just write \f[CR].\f[R] (period) instead.
In regular expressions, this means \[dq]accept any character here\[dq].
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger register credit.card
.EE
.SS Unicode characters
hledger is expected to handle non\-ascii characters correctly:
.IP \[bu] 2
they should be parsed correctly in input files and on the command line,
by all hledger tools (add, iadd, hledger\-web\[aq]s search/add/edit
forms, etc.)
.IP \[bu] 2
they should be displayed correctly by all hledger tools, and on\-screen
alignment should be preserved.
.PP
This requires a well\-configured environment.
Here are some tips:
.IP \[bu] 2
A system locale must be configured, and it must be one that can decode
the characters being used.
In bash, you can set a locale like this:
\f[CR]export LANG=en_US.UTF\-8\f[R].
There are some more details in Troubleshooting.
This step is essential \- without it, hledger will quit on encountering
a non\-ascii character (as with all GHC\-compiled programs).
.IP \[bu] 2
Your terminal software (eg Terminal.app, iTerm, CMD.exe, xterm..)
must support unicode.
On Windows, you may need to use Windows Terminal and/or enable UTF\-8
support.
.IP \[bu] 2
The terminal must be using a font which includes the required unicode
glyphs.
.IP \[bu] 2
The terminal should be configured to display wide characters as double
width (for report alignment).
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows, for best results you should run hledger in the same kind of
environment in which it was built.
Eg hledger built in the standard CMD.EXE environment (like the binaries
on our download page) might show display problems when run in a cygwin
or msys terminal, and vice versa.
(See eg #961).
.SS Regular expressions
A regular expression (regexp) is a small piece of text where certain
characters (like \f[CR].\f[R], \f[CR]\[ha]\f[R], \f[CR]$\f[R],
\f[CR]+\f[R], \f[CR]*\f[R], \f[CR]()\f[R], \f[CR]|\f[R], \f[CR][]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[rs]\f[R]) have special meanings, forming a tiny language for
matching text precisely \- very useful in hledger and elsewhere.
To learn all about them, visit regular\-expressions.info.
.PP
hledger supports regexps whenever you are entering a pattern to match
something, eg in query arguments, account aliases, CSV if rules,
hledger\-web\[aq]s search form, hledger\-ui\[aq]s \f[CR]/\f[R] search,
etc.
You may need to wrap them in quotes, especially at the command line (see
Special characters above).
Here are some examples:
.PP

\[aq]big \[rs]$ bank\[aq]        big $ bank    ( \[rs] disables following character\[aq]s special meaning )
\[aq]\[rs]bbank\[rs]b\[aq]           assets:bank, assets:bank:savings  ( \[rs]b matches word boundaries )

.EE
.SS hledger\[aq]s regular expressions
hledger\[aq]s regular expressions come from the regex\-tdfa library.
If they\[aq]re not doing what you expect, it\[aq]s important to know
exactly what they support:
.IP "1." 3
they are case insensitive
.IP "2." 3
they are infix matching (they do not need to match the entire thing
being matched)
.IP "3." 3
they are POSIX ERE (extended regular expressions)
.IP "4." 3
they also support GNU word boundaries (\f[CR]\[rs]b\f[R],
\f[CR]\[rs]B\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]<\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]>\f[R])
.IP "5." 3
backreferences are supported when doing text replacement in account
aliases or CSV rules, where backreferences can be used in the
replacement string to reference capturing groups in the search regexp.
Otherwise, if you write \f[CR]\[rs]1\f[R], it will match the digit
\f[CR]1\f[R].
.IP "6." 3
they do not support mode modifiers (\f[CR](?s)\f[R]), character classes
(\f[CR]\[rs]w\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]d\f[R]), or anything else not mentioned
above.
.PP
Some things to note:
.IP \[bu] 2
In the \f[CR]alias\f[R] directive and \f[CR]\-\-alias\f[R] option,
regular expressions must be enclosed in forward slashes
(\f[CR]/REGEX/\f[R]).
Elsewhere in hledger, these are not required.
.IP \[bu] 2
In queries, to match a regular expression metacharacter like
\f[CR]$\f[R] as a literal character, prepend a backslash.
Eg to search for amounts with the dollar sign in hledger\-web, write
\f[CR]cur:\[rs]$\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
On the command line, some metacharacters like \f[CR]$\f[R] have a
special meaning to the shell and so must be escaped at least once more.
See Special characters.
.SS Argument files
You can save a set of command line options and arguments in a file, and
then reuse them by writing \f[CR]\[at]FILENAME\f[R] as a command line
argument.
Eg: \f[CR]hledger bal \[at]foo.args\f[R].
.PP
An argument file\[aq]s format is more restrictive than the command line.
Each line should contain just one option or argument.
Don\[aq]t use spaces except inside quotes; write \f[CR]=\f[R] or nothing
between a flag and its argument.
If you use quotes, they must enclose the whole line.
For the special characters mentioned above, use one less level of
quoting than you would at the command line.
.SS Config files
With hledger 1.40+, you can save extra command line options and
arguments in a more featureful hledger config file.
Here\[aq]s a small example:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]# General options are listed first, and used with hledger commands that support them.\f[R]
\-\-pretty

\f[I]# Options following a \[ga][COMMAND]\[ga] heading are used with that hledger command only.\f[R]
\f[B][print]\f[R]
\-\-explicit \-\-show\-costs
.EE
.PP
To use a config file, specify it with the \f[CR]\-\-conf\f[R] option.
Its options will be inserted near the start of your command line, so you
can override them with command line options if needed.
.PP
Or, you can set up an automatic config file that is used whenever you
run hledger, by creating \f[CR]hledger.conf\f[R] in the current
directory or above, or \f[CR].hledger.conf\f[R] in your home directory
(\f[CR]\[ti]/.hledger.conf\f[R]), or \f[CR]hledger.conf\f[R] in your XDG
config directory (\f[CR]\[ti]/.config/hledger/hledger.conf\f[R]).
.PP
Here is another example config you could start with:
https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/hledger.conf.sample
.PP
You can put not only options, but also arguments in a config file.
If the first word in a config file\[aq]s top (general) section does not
begin with a dash (eg: \f[CR]print\f[R]), it is treated as the command
argument (overriding any argument on the command line).
.PP
On unix machines, you can add a shebang line at the top of a config
file, set executable permission on the file, and use it like a script.
Eg (the \f[CR]\-S\f[R] is needed on some operating systems):
.IP
.EX
#!/usr/bin/env \-S hledger \-\-conf
.EE
.PP
You can ignore config files by adding the
\f[CR]\-n\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-no\-conf\f[R] flag to the command line.
This is useful when using hledger in scripts, or when troubleshooting.
When both \f[CR]\-\-conf\f[R] and \f[CR]\-\-no\-conf\f[R] options are
used, the right\-most wins.
.PP
To inspect the processing of config files, use \f[CR]\-\-debug\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-\-debug=8\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Warning!\f[R]
.PP
There aren\[aq]t many hledger features that need a warning, but this is
one!
.PP
Automatic config files, while convenient, also make hledger less
predictable and dependable.
It\[aq]s easy to make a config file that changes a report\[aq]s
behaviour, or breaks your hledger\-using scripts/applications, in ways
that will surprise you later.
.PP
If you don\[aq]t want this,
.IP "1." 3
Just don\[aq]t create a hledger.conf file on your machine.
.IP "2." 3
Also be alert to downloaded directories which may contain a hledger.conf
file.
.IP "3." 3
Also if you are sharing scripts or examples or support, consider that
others may have a hledger.conf file.
.PP
Conversely, once you decide to use this feature, try to remember:
.IP "1." 3
Whenever a hledger command does not work as expected, try it again with
\f[CR]\-n\f[R] (\f[CR]\-\-no\-conf\f[R]) to see if a config file was to
blame.
.IP "2." 3
Whenever you call hledger from a script, consider whether that call
should use \f[CR]\-n\f[R] or not.
.IP "3." 3
Be conservative about what you put in your config file; try to consider
the effect on all your reports.
.IP "4." 3
To troubleshoot the effect of config files, run with
\f[CR]\-\-debug\f[R] or \f[CR]\-\-debug 8\f[R].
.PP
The config file feature was added in hledger 1.40 and is considered
\f[I]experimental\f[R].
.SS Shell completions
If you use the bash shell, you can optionally set up context\-sensitive
autocompletions when you press TAB in a hledger command line.
At a bash shell prompt, try pressing \f[CR]hledger<SPACE><TAB><TAB>\f[R]
(should list all hledger commands) or
\f[CR]hledger reg acct:<TAB><TAB>\f[R] (should list your top\-level
account names).
If completions aren\[aq]t working, or for more details, see Install >
Shell completions.
.SH Output
.SS Output destination
hledger commands send their output to the terminal by default.
You can of course redirect this, eg into a file, using standard shell
syntax:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print > foo.txt
.EE
.PP
Some commands (print, register, stats, the balance commands) also
provide the \f[CR]\-o\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-output\-file\f[R] option, which
does the same thing without needing the shell.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-o foo.txt
$ hledger print \-o \-        # write to stdout (the default)
.EE
.SS Output format
Some commands offer other kinds of output, not just text on the
terminal.
Here are those commands and the formats currently supported:

.TE
.PP
You can also see which output formats a command supports by running
\f[CR]hledger CMD \-h\f[R] and looking for the
\f[CR]\-O\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-output\-format=FMT\f[R] option,
.PP
You can select the output format by using that option:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-O csv    # print CSV to standard output
.EE
.PP
or by choosing a suitable filename extension with the
\f[CR]\-o\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-output\-file=FILE.FMT\f[R] option:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger balancesheet \-o foo.csv    # write CSV to foo.csv
.EE
.PP
The \f[CR]\-O\f[R] option can be combined with \f[CR]\-o\f[R] to
override the file extension if needed:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger balancesheet \-o foo.txt \-O csv    # write CSV to foo.txt
.EE
.SS Paging
On unix\-like systems, when displaying large output in the terminal,
hledger tries to use a pager when appropriate: the one specified by the
\f[CR]PAGER\f[R] environment variable, otherwise \f[CR]less\f[R] if
available, otherwise \f[CR]more\f[R] if available.
The pager shows one page of text at a time, and lets you scroll around
to see more.
While it is active, usually \f[CR]SPACE\f[R] shows the next page,
\f[CR]q\f[R] quits, and \f[CR]?\f[R] shows more features.
.PP
The pager is expected to display ANSI color and text styling if
possible.
hledger adds \f[CR]R\f[R] to the \f[CR]LESS\f[R] and \f[CR]MORE\f[R]
environment variables to enable this in \f[CR]less\f[R] (and in its
\f[CR]more\f[R] compatibility mode).
If you use a different pager, you might need to configure it similarly,
to avoid seeing junk on screen.
Or you can set the \f[CR]NO_COLOR\f[R] environment variable described
below.
.PP
You can prevent the use of a pager by providing the
\f[CR]\-\-no\-pager\f[R] flag at the command line, or in a config file.
.PP
Here are some notes about the various output formats.
.SS Text output
This is the default: human readable, plain text report output, suitable
for viewing with a monospace font in a terminal.
If your data contains unicode or wide characters, you\[aq]ll need a
terminal and font that render those correctly.
(This can be challenging on MS Windows.)
.PP
Some reports (\f[CR]register\f[R], \f[CR]aregister\f[R]) will use the
width indicated by the \f[CR]COLUMNS\f[R] environment variable.
If your shell and terminal are working well, they will keep COLUMNS
updated as you resize the window.
So register reports normally will use the full window width.
When this isn\[aq]t working or you want to override it, you can manually
set COLUMNS, or use the \f[CR]\-w\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-width\f[R] option.
.PP
Balance reports (\f[CR]balance\f[R], \f[CR]balancesheet\f[R],
\f[CR]incomestatement\f[R]...)
use whatever width they need.
Multi\-period multi\-currency reports can often be wider than the
window.
Besides using a pager, helpful techniques for this situation include
\f[CR]\-\-layout=bare\f[R], \f[CR]\-V\f[R], \f[CR]cur:\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\-transpose\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-tree\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-depth\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\-drop\f[R], switching to html output, etc.
.PP
(Help output uses a pager automatically when appropriate, but regular
reports do not, currently.)
.SS Colour
hledger tries to detect ANSI color and text styling support and use it
when appropriate, though currently rather minimally: some reports show
negative numbers in red, and help output uses bold text for emphasis.
.PP
You can override this in the usual ways.
If the \f[CR]NO_COLOR\f[R] environment variable is set, colour will be
disabled by default.
Or you can use the \f[CR]\-\-color/\-\-colour\f[R] option with a
\f[CR]y\f[R]/\f[CR]yes\f[R] value, or \f[CR]n\f[R]/\f[CR]no\f[R], to
force colour on or off.
(This option doesn\[aq]t work in a config file yet.)
.SS Box\-drawing
By default, hledger draws table borders using ascii characters, to
minimise the chance of display problems.
.PP
If your terminal and font support box\-drawing characters (they probably
do), you will probably want to use the \f[CR]\-\-pretty\f[R] flag to
show prettier tables.
This is a good flag to add to your hledger config file.
.SS HTML output
HTML output can be styled by an optional \f[CR]hledger.css\f[R] file in
the same directory.
.PP
HTML output will be UTF\-8 encoded.
If your web browser is showing junk characters, you may need to change
its text encoding to UTF\-8.
Eg in Safari, see View \-> Text Encoding and Settings \-> Advanced \->
Default Encoding.
.SS CSV / TSV output
In CSV or TSV output, digit group marks (such as thousands separators)
are disabled automatically.
.SS FODS output
FODS is the OpenDocument Spreadsheet format as plain XML, as accepted by
LibreOffice and OpenOffice.
If you use their spreadsheet applications, this is better than CSV
because it works across locales (decimal point vs.
decimal comma, character encoding stored in XML header, thus no problems
with umlauts), it supports fixed header rows and columns, cell types
(string vs.
number vs.
date), separation of number and currency (currency is displayed but the
cell type is still a number accessible for computation), styles (bold),
borders.
Btw.
you can still extract CSV from FODS/ODS using various utilities like
\f[CR]libreoffice \-\-headless\f[R] or ods2csv.
.SS Beancount output
This is Beancount\[aq]s journal format.
You can use this to export your hledger data to Beancount, perhaps to
query it with Beancount Query Language or with the Fava web app.
hledger will try to adjust your data to suit Beancount.
If you plan to export often, you may want to follow Beancount\[aq]s
conventions in your hledger data, to ease conversion.
Eg use Beancount\-friendly account names, currency codes instead of
currency symbols, and avoid virtual postings, redundant cost notation,
etc.
.PP
Here are more details, included here for now (see also \[dq]hledger and
Beancount\[dq] https://hledger.org/beancount.html).
.SS Beancount account names
hledger will try adjust your account names, if needed, to Beancount
account names, by capitalising, replacing unsupported characters with
\f[CR]\-\f[R], and prepending \f[CR]B\f[R] to parts which don\[aq]t
begin with a letter or digit.
(It\[aq]s possible for this to convert distinct hledger account names to
the same beancount name.
Eg, hledger\[aq]s automatic equity conversion accounts can have currency
symbols in their name, so \f[CR]equity:conversion:$\-€\f[R] becomes
\f[CR]equity:conversion:B\-\-\-\f[R].)
.PP
In addition, you must ensure that the top level account names are
\f[CR]Assets\f[R], \f[CR]Liabilities\f[R], \f[CR]Equity\f[R],
\f[CR]Income\f[R], and \f[CR]Expenses\f[R], which Beancount requires.
If yours are named differently, you can use account aliases, usually in
the form of \f[CR]\-\-alias\f[R] options, possibly stored in a config
file.
(An example: hledger2beancount.conf)
.SS Beancount commodity names
hledger will adjust your commodity names, if needed, to Beancount
commodity/currency names, which must be 2\-24 uppercase letters, digits,
or \f[CR]\[aq]\f[R], \f[CR].\f[R], \f[CR]_\f[R], \f[CR]\-\f[R],
beginning with a letter and ending with a letter or digit.
hledger will convert known currency symbols to ISO 4217 currency codes.
Otherwise, it will capitalise letters, replace unsupported characters
with a dash (\-), and prepend/append a \[dq]B\[dq] when needed.
(It\[aq]s possible for this to generate unreadable commodity names, or
to convert distinct hledger commodity names to the same beancount name.)
.SS Beancount virtual postings
Beancount doesn\[aq]t allow unbalanced/virtual postings, so you will
need to comment those, or use \f[CR]\-\-real\f[R] to exclude
transactions that use them.
(If you have transactions which are a mixture of balanced and unbalanced
postings, you\[aq]ll have to do something more.)
.SS Beancount costs
Beancount doesn\[aq]t allow redundant cost notation as hledger does.
If you have entries like this, you will need to comment out either the
costs or the equity postings.
.SS Beancount operating currency
Declaring an operating currency improves Beancount and Fava reports.
You can do this manually by adding a line like this to the beancount
journal:
.IP
.EX
option \[dq]operating_currency\[dq] \[dq]USD\[dq]
.EE
.SS SQL output
SQL output is expected to work at least with SQLite, MySQL and Postgres.
.PP
The SQL statements are expected to be executed in the empty database.
If you already have tables created via SQL output of hledger, you would
probably want to either clear data from these (via \f[CR]delete\f[R] or
\f[CR]truncate\f[R] SQL statements) or \f[CR]drop\f[R] the tables
completely before import; otherwise your postings would be duplicated.
.PP
For SQLite, it is more useful if you modify the generated \f[CR]id\f[R]
field to be a PRIMARY KEY.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-O sql | sed \[aq]s/id serial/id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL/g\[aq] | ...
.EE
.PP
This is not yet much used; feedback is welcome.
.SS JSON output
Our JSON is rather large and verbose, since it is a faithful
representation of hledger\[aq]s internal data types.
To understand its structure, read the Haskell type definitions, which
are mostly in
https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/hledger\-lib/Hledger/Data/Types.hs.
hledger\-web\[aq]s OpenAPI specification may also be relevant.
.PP
hledger stores numbers with sometimes up to 255 significant digits.
This is too many digits for most JSON consumers, so in JSON output we
round numbers to at most 10 decimal places.
(We don\[aq]t limit the number of integer digits.)
If you find this causing problems, please let us know.
Related: #1195
.PP
This is not yet much used; feedback is welcome.
.SS Commodity styles
When displaying amounts, hledger infers a standard display style for
each commodity/currency, as described below in Commodity display style.
.PP
If needed, this can be overridden by a
\f[CR]\-c/\-\-commodity\-style\f[R] option (except for cost amounts and
amounts displayed by the \f[CR]print\f[R] command, which are always
displayed with all decimal digits).
For example, the following will force dollar amounts to be displayed as
shown:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-c \[aq]$1.000,0\[aq]
.EE
.PP
This option can repeated to set the display style for multiple
commodities/currencies.
Its argument is as described in the commodity directive.
.PP
In some cases hledger will adjust number formatting to improve their
parseability (such as adding trailing decimal marks when needed).
.SS Debug output
We intend hledger to be relatively easy to troubleshoot, introspect and
develop.
You can add \f[CR]\-\-debug[=N]\f[R] to any hledger command line to see
additional debug output.
N ranges from 1 (least output, the default) to 9 (maximum output).
Typically you would start with 1 and increase until you are seeing
enough.
Debug output goes to stderr, and is not affected by
\f[CR]\-o/\-\-output\-file\f[R] (unless you redirect stderr to stdout,
eg: \f[CR]2>&1\f[R]).
It will be interleaved with normal output, which can help reveal when
parts of the code are evaluated.
To capture debug output in a log file instead, you can usually redirect
stderr, eg:
.IP
.EX
hledger bal \-\-debug=3 2>hledger.log
.EE
.PP
(This option doesn\[aq]t work in a config file yet.)
.SH Environment
These environment variables affect hledger:
.PP
\f[B]COLUMNS\f[R] This is normally set by your terminal; some hledger
commands (\f[CR]register\f[R]) will format their output to this width.
If not set, they will try to use the available terminal width.
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] The main journal file to use when not specified
with \f[CR]\-f/\-\-file\f[R].
Default: \f[CR]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]NO_COLOR\f[R] If this environment variable exists (with any value,
including empty), hledger will not use ANSI color codes in terminal
output, unless overridden by an explicit \f[CR]\-\-color=y\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-\-colour=y\f[R] option.
.SH PART 2: DATA FORMATS
.SH Journal
hledger\[aq]s usual data source is a plain text file containing journal
entries in hledger \f[CR]journal\f[R] format.
If you\[aq]re looking for a quick reference, jump ahead to the journal
cheatsheet (or use the table of contents at
https://hledger.org/hledger.html).
.PP
This file represents an accounting General Journal.
The \f[CR].journal\f[R] file extension is most often used, though not
strictly required.
The journal file contains a number of transaction entries, each
describing a transfer of money (or any commodity) between two or more
named accounts, in a simple format readable by both hledger and humans.
.PP
hledger\[aq]s journal format is compatible with most of Ledger\[aq]s
journal format, but not all of it.
The differences and interoperation tips are described at hledger and
Ledger.
With some care, and by avoiding incompatible features, you can keep your
hledger journal readable by Ledger and vice versa.
This can useful eg for comparing the behaviour of one app against the
other.
.PP
You can use hledger without learning any more about this file; just use
the add or web or import commands to create and update it.
.PP
Many users, though, edit the journal file with a text editor, and track
changes with a version control system such as git.
Editor add\-ons such as ledger\-mode or hledger\-mode for Emacs,
vim\-ledger for Vim, and hledger\-vscode for Visual Studio Code, make
this easier, adding colour, formatting, tab completion, and useful
commands.
See Editor configuration at hledger.org for the full list.
.PP
A hledger journal file can contain three kinds of thing: comment lines,
transactions, and/or directives (including periodic transaction rules
and auto posting rules).
Understanding the journal file format will also give you a good
understanding of hledger\[aq]s data model.
Here\[aq]s a quick cheatsheet/overview, followed by detailed
descriptions of each part.
.SS Journal cheatsheet
.IP
.EX
# Here is the main syntax of hledger\[aq]s journal format
# (omitting extra Ledger compatibility syntax).

# Some of them require 2 or more spaces before the semicolon.

###############################################################################

# 2. Directives customise processing or output in some way.
# You don\[aq]t need any directives to get started.
# But they can add more error checking, or change how things are displayed.
# They begin with a word, letter, or symbol. 
# They are most often placed at the top, before transactions.

#   ACCOUNT1  AMOUNT  ; A posting of an amount to/from this account, indented.
#   ACCOUNT2  AMOUNT  ; A second posting, balancing the first.

2024/1/1
.EE
.SS Comments
Lines in the journal will be ignored if they begin with a hash
(\f[CR]#\f[R]) or a semicolon (\f[CR];\f[R]).
(See also Other syntax.)
hledger will also ignore regions beginning with a \f[CR]comment\f[R]
line and ending with an \f[CR]end comment\f[R] line (or file end).
Here\[aq]s a suggestion for choosing between them:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]#\f[R] for top\-level notes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR];\f[R] for commenting out things temporarily
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]comment\f[R] for quickly commenting large regions (remember
it\[aq]s there, or you might get confused)
.PP
Eg:
.IP
.EX
# a comment line
; another commentline
comment
A multi\-line comment block,
continuing until \[dq]end comment\[dq] directive
or the end of the current file.
end comment
.EE
.PP
Some hledger entries can have same\-line comments attached to them, from
; (semicolon) to end of line.
See Transaction comments, Posting comments, and Account comments below.
.SS Transactions
Transactions are the main unit of information in a journal file.
They represent events, typically a movement of some quantity of
commodities between two or more named accounts.
.PP
Each transaction is recorded as a journal entry, beginning with a simple
date in column 0.
This can be followed by any of the following optional fields, separated
by spaces:
.IP \[bu] 2
a status character (empty, \f[CR]!\f[R], or \f[CR]*\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
a code (any short number or text, enclosed in parentheses)
.IP \[bu] 2
a description (any remaining text until end of line or a semicolon)
.IP \[bu] 2
a comment (any remaining text following a semicolon until end of line,
and any following indented lines beginning with a semicolon)
.IP \[bu] 2
0 or more indented \f[I]posting\f[R] lines, describing what was
transferred and the accounts involved (indented comment lines are also
allowed, but not blank lines or non\-indented lines).
.PP
Here\[aq]s a simple journal file containing one transaction:
.IP
.EX
2008/01/01 income
  assets:bank:checking   $1
  income:salary         $\-1
.EE
.SS Dates
.SS Simple dates
Dates in the journal file use \f[I]simple dates\f[R] format:
\f[CR]YYYY\-MM\-DD\f[R] or \f[CR]YYYY/MM/DD\f[R] or
\f[CR]YYYY.MM.DD\f[R], with leading zeros optional.
The year may be omitted, in which case it will be inferred from the
context: the current transaction, the default year set with a
\f[CR]Y\f[R] directive, or the current date when the command is run.
Some examples: \f[CR]2010\-01\-31\f[R], \f[CR]2010/01/31\f[R],
\f[CR]2010.1.31\f[R], \f[CR]1/31\f[R].
.PP
(The UI also accepts simple dates, as well as the more flexible smart
dates documented in the hledger manual.)
.SS Posting dates
You can give individual postings a different date from their parent
transaction, by adding a posting comment containing a tag (see below)
like \f[CR]date:DATE\f[R].
This is probably the best way to control posting dates precisely.
Eg in this example the expense should appear in May reports, and the
deduction from checking should be reported on 6/1 for easy bank
reconciliation:
.IP
.EX
2015/5/30
    expenses:food     $10  ; food purchased on saturday 5/30
    assets:checking        ; bank cleared it on monday, date:6/1
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f t.j register food
2015\-05\-30                      expenses:food                  $10           $10
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f t.j register checking
2015\-06\-01                      assets:checking               $\-10          $\-10
.EE
.PP
DATE should be a simple date; if the year is not specified it will use
the year of the transaction\[aq]s date.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The \f[CR]date:\f[R] tag must have a valid simple date value if it is
present, eg a \f[CR]date:\f[R] tag with no value is not allowed.
.SS Status
Transactions (or individual postings within a transaction) can have a
status mark, which is a single character before the transaction
description (or posting account name), separated from it by a space,
indicating one of three statuses:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l l.
T{
mark \ 
T}@T{
status
T}
_
T{
\ 
T}@T{
unmarked
T}
T{
\f[CR]!\f[R]
T}@T{
pending
T}
T{
\f[CR]*\f[R]
T}@T{
cleared
T}
.TE
.PP
When reporting, you can filter by status with the
\f[CR]\-U/\-\-unmarked\f[R], \f[CR]\-P/\-\-pending\f[R], and
\f[CR]\-C/\-\-cleared\f[R] flags (and you can combine these, eg
\f[CR]\-UP\f[R] to match all except cleared things).
Or you can use the \f[CR]status:\f[R], \f[CR]status:!\f[R], and
\f[CR]status:*\f[R] queries, or the U, P, C keys in hledger\-ui.
.PP
(Note: in Ledger the \[dq]unmarked\[dq] state is called
\[dq]uncleared\[dq]; in hledger we renamed it to \[dq]unmarked\[dq] for
semantic clarity.)
.PP
Status marks are optional, but can be helpful eg for reconciling with
real\-world accounts.
Some editor modes provide highlighting and shortcuts for working with
status.
Eg in Emacs ledger\-mode, you can toggle transaction status with C\-c
C\-e, or posting status with C\-c C\-c.
.PP
What \[dq]uncleared\[dq], \[dq]pending\[dq], and \[dq]cleared\[dq]
actually mean is up to you.
Here\[aq]s one suggestion:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
lw(9.7n) lw(60.3n).
T{
status
T}@T{
meaning
T}
_
T{
uncleared
T}@T{
recorded but not yet reconciled; needs review
T}
T{
pending
T}@T{
tentatively reconciled (if needed, eg during a big reconciliation)
T}
T{
cleared
T}@T{
complete, reconciled as far as possible, and considered correct
T}
.TE
.PP
With this scheme, you would use \f[CR]\-PC\f[R] to see the current
balance at your bank, \f[CR]\-U\f[R] to see things which will probably
hit your bank soon (like uncashed checks), and no flags to see the most
up\-to\-date state of your finances.
.SS Code
After the status mark, but before the description, you can optionally
write a transaction \[dq]code\[dq], enclosed in parentheses.
This is a good place to record a check number, or some other important
transaction id or reference number.
.SS Description
After the date, status mark and/or code fields, the rest of the line (or
until a comment is begun with \f[CR];\f[R]) is the transaction\[aq]s
description.
Here you can describe the transaction (called the \[dq]narration\[dq] in
traditional bookkeeping), or you can record a payee/payer name, or you
can leave it empty.
.PP
Transaction descriptions show up in print output and in register
reports, and can be listed with the descriptions command.
.PP
You can query by description with \f[CR]desc:DESCREGEX\f[R], or pivot on
description with \f[CR]\-\-pivot desc\f[R].
.SS Payee and note
Sometimes people want a dedicated payee/payer field that can be queried
and checked more strictly.
If you want that, you can write a \f[CR]|\f[R] (pipe) character in the
description.
This divides it into a \[dq]payee\[dq] field on the left, and a
\[dq]note\[dq] field on the right.
(Either can be empty.)
.PP
You can query these with \f[CR]payee:PAYEEREGEX\f[R] and
\f[CR]note:NOTEREGEX\f[R], list their values with the payees and notes
commands, or pivot on \f[CR]payee\f[R] or \f[CR]note\f[R].
.PP
Note: in transactions with no \f[CR]|\f[R] character, description,
payee, and note all have the same value.
Once a \f[CR]|\f[R] is added, they become distinct.
(If you\[aq]d like to change this behaviour, please propose it on the
mail list.)
.PP
If you want more strict error checking, you can declare the valid payee
names with payee directives, and then enforce these with hledger check
payees.
(Note: because of the above, for this you\[aq]ll need to ensure every
transaction description contains a \f[CR]|\f[R] and therefore a
checkable payee name, even if it\[aq]s empty.)
.SS Transaction comments
Text following \f[CR];\f[R], after a transaction description, and/or on
indented lines immediately below it, form comments for that transaction.
They are reproduced by \f[CR]print\f[R] but otherwise ignored, except
they may contain tags, which are not ignored.
.IP
.EX
2012\-01\-01 something  ; a transaction comment
    ; a second line of transaction comment
    expenses   1
    assets
.EE
.SS Postings
A posting is an addition of some amount to, or removal of some amount
from, an account.
Each posting line begins with at least one space or tab (2 or 4 spaces
is common), followed by:
.IP \[bu] 2
(optional) a status character (empty, \f[CR]!\f[R], or \f[CR]*\f[R]),
followed by a space
.IP \[bu] 2
(required) an account name (any text, optionally containing \f[B]single
spaces\f[R], until end of line or a double space)
.IP \[bu] 2
(optional) \f[B]two or more spaces\f[R] (or tabs) followed by an amount.
.PP
If the amount is positive, it is being added to the account; if
negative, it is being removed from the account.
.PP
The posting amounts in a transaction must sum up to zero, indicating
that the inflows and outflows are equal.
We call this a balanced transaction.
(You can read more about the nitty\-gritty details of \[dq]sum up to
zero\[dq] in Transaction balancing below.)
.PP
As a convenience, you can optionally leave one amount blank; hledger
will infer what it should be so as to balance the transaction.
.SS Debits and credits
The traditional accounting concepts of debit and credit of course exist
in hledger, but we represent them with numeric sign, as described above.
Positive and negative posting amounts represent debits and credits
respectively.
.PP
You don\[aq]t need to remember that, but if you would like to \- eg for
helping newcomers or for talking with your accountant \- here\[aq]s a
handy mnemonic:
.PP
\f[I]\f[CI]debit  / plus  / left  / short  words\f[I]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[I]\f[CI]credit / minus / right / longer words\f[I]\f[R]
.SS The two space delimiter
Be sure to notice the unusual separator between the account name and the
following amount.
Because hledger allows account names with spaces in them, you must
separate the account name and amount (if any) by \f[B]two or more
spaces\f[R] (or tabs).
It\[aq]s easy to forget at first.
If you ever see the amount being treated as part of the account name,
you\[aq]ll know you probably need to add another space between them.
.SS Account names
Accounts are the main way of categorising things in hledger.
As in Double Entry Bookkeeping, they can represent real world accounts
(such as a bank account), or more abstract categories such as \[dq]money
borrowed from Frank\[dq] or \[dq]money spent on electricity\[dq].
.PP
You can use any account names you like, but we usually start with the
traditional accounting categories, which in english are
\f[CR]assets\f[R], \f[CR]liabilities\f[R], \f[CR]equity\f[R],
\f[CR]revenues\f[R], \f[CR]expenses\f[R].
(You might see these referred to as A, L, E, R, X for short.)
.PP
For more precise reporting, we usually divide the top level accounts
into more detailed subaccounts, by writing a full colon between account
name parts.
For example, from the account names \f[CR]assets:bank:checking\f[R] and
\f[CR]expenses:food\f[R], hledger will infer this hierarchy of five
accounts:
.IP
.EX
assets
assets:bank
assets:bank:checking
expenses
expenses:food
.EE
.PP
Shown as an outline, the hierarchical tree structure is more clear:
.IP
.EX
assets
 bank
  checking
expenses
 food
.EE
.PP
hledger reports can summarise the account tree to any depth, so you can
go as deep as you like with subcategories, but keeping your account
names relatively simple may be best when starting out.
.PP
Account names may be capitalised or not; they may contain letters,
numbers, symbols, or single spaces.
Note, when an account name and an amount are written on the same line,
they must be separated by \f[B]two or more spaces\f[R] (or tabs).
.PP
Parentheses or brackets enclosing the full account name indicate virtual
postings, described below.
Parentheses or brackets internal to the account name have no special
meaning.
.PP
Account names can be altered temporarily or permanently by account
aliases.
.SS Amounts
After the account name, there is usually an amount.
(Remember: between account name and amount, there must be two or more
spaces.)
.PP
hledger\[aq]s amount format is flexible, supporting several
international formats.
Here are some examples.
Amounts have a number (the \[dq]quantity\[dq]):
.IP
.EX
1
.EE
.PP
\&..and usually a currency symbol or commodity name (more on this
below), to the left or right of the quantity, with or without a
separating space:
.IP
.EX
$1
4000 AAPL
3 \[dq]green apples\[dq]
.EE
.PP
Amounts can be preceded by a minus sign (or a plus sign, though plus is
the default), The sign can be written before or after a left\-side
commodity symbol:
.IP
.EX
\-$1
$\-1
.EE
.PP
One or more spaces between the sign and the number are acceptable when
parsing (but they won\[aq]t be displayed in output):
.IP
.EX
+ $1
$\-      1
.EE
.PP
Scientific E notation is allowed:
.IP
.EX
1E\-6
EUR 1E3
.EE
.PP
.SS Decimal marks
A \f[I]decimal mark\f[R] can be written as a period or a comma:
.IP
.EX
1.23
1,23
.EE
.PP
Both of these are common in international number formats, so hledger is
not biased towards one or the other.
Because hledger also supports digit group marks (eg thousands
separators), this means that a number like \f[CR]1,000\f[R] or
\f[CR]1.000\f[R] containing just one period or comma is ambiguous.
In such cases, hledger by default assumes it is a decimal mark, and will
parse both of those as 1.
.PP
To help hledger parse such ambiguous numbers more accurately, if you use
digit group marks, we recommend declaring the decimal mark explicitly.
The best way is to add a \f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R] directive at the top
of each data file, like this:
.IP
.EX
decimal\-mark .
.EE
.PP
Or you can declare it per commodity with \f[CR]commodity\f[R]
directives, described below.
.PP
hledger also accepts numbers like \f[CR]10.\f[R] with no digits after
the decimal mark (and will sometimes display numbers that way to
disambiguate them \- see Trailing decimal marks).
.SS Digit group marks
In the integer part of the amount quantity (left of the decimal mark),
groups of digits can optionally be separated by a \f[I]digit group
mark\f[R] \- a comma or period (whichever is not used as decimal mark),
or a space (several Unicode space variants, like no\-break space, are
also accepted).
\ So these are all valid amounts in a journal file:
.IP
.EX
     $1,000,000.00
  EUR 2.000.000,00
INR 9,99,99,999.00
      1 000 000.00   ; <\- ordinary space  
      1\ 000\ 000.00   ; <\- no\-break space
.EE
.SS Commodity
Amounts in hledger have both a \[dq]quantity\[dq], which is a signed
decimal number, and a \[dq]commodity\[dq], which is a currency symbol,
stock ticker, or any word or phrase describing something you are
tracking.
.PP
If the commodity name contains non\-letters (spaces, numbers, or
punctuation), you must always write it inside double quotes
(\f[CR]\[dq]green apples\[dq]\f[R], \f[CR]\[dq]ABC123\[dq]\f[R]).
.PP
If you write just a bare number, that too will have a commodity, with
name \f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R]; we call that the \[dq]no\-symbol
commodity\[dq].
.PP
Actually, hledger combines these single\-commodity amounts into more
powerful multi\-commodity amounts, which are what it works with most of
the time.
A multi\-commodity amount could be, eg:
\f[CR]1 USD, 2 EUR, 3.456 TSLA\f[R].
In practice, you will only see multi\-commodity amounts in hledger\[aq]s
output; you can\[aq]t write them directly in the journal file.
\
.PP
By default, the format of amounts in the journal influences how hledger
displays them in output.
This is explained in Commodity display style below.
.PP
.SS Costs
After a posting amount, you can note its cost (when buying) or selling
price (when selling) in another commodity, by writing either
\f[CR]\[at] UNITPRICE\f[R] or \f[CR]\[at]\[at] TOTALPRICE\f[R] after it.
This indicates a conversion transaction, where one commodity is
exchanged for another.
.PP
(You might also see this called \[dq]transaction price\[dq] in hledger
docs, discussions, or code; that term was directionally neutral and
reminded that it is a price specific to a transaction, but we now just
call it \[dq]cost\[dq], with the understanding that the transaction
could be a purchase or a sale.)
.PP
Costs are usually written explicitly with \f[CR]\[at]\f[R] or
\f[CR]\[at]\[at]\f[R], but can also be inferred automatically for simple
multi\-commodity transactions.
Note, if costs are inferred, the order of postings is significant; the
first posting will have a cost attached, in the commodity of the second.
.PP
As an example, here are several ways to record purchases of a foreign
currency in hledger, using the cost notation either explicitly or
implicitly:
.IP "1." 3
Write the price per unit, as \f[CR]\[at] UNITPRICE\f[R] after the
amount:
.RS 4
.IP
.EX
2009/1/1
  assets:euros     €100 \[at] $1.35  ; one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
  assets:dollars                 ; balancing amount is \-$135.00
.EE
.RE
.IP "2." 3
Write the total price, as \f[CR]\[at]\[at] TOTALPRICE\f[R] after the
amount:
.RS 4
.IP
.EX
2009/1/1
  assets:euros     €100 \[at]\[at] $135  ; one hundred euros purchased at $135 for the lot
  assets:dollars
.EE
.RE
.IP "3." 3
Specify amounts for all postings, using exactly two commodities, and let
hledger infer the price that balances the transaction.
Note the effect of posting order: the price is added to first posting,
making it \f[CR]€100 \[at]\[at] $135\f[R], as in example 2:
.RS 4
.IP
.EX
2009/1/1
  assets:euros     €100          ; one hundred euros purchased
  assets:dollars  $\-135          ; for $135
.EE
.RE
.PP
Amounts can be converted to cost at report time using the
\f[CR]\-B/\-\-cost\f[R] flag; this is discussed more in the Cost
reporting section.
.PP
Note that the cost normally should be a positive amount, though it\[aq]s
not required to be.
This can be a little confusing, see discussion at
\-\-infer\-market\-prices: market prices from transactions.
.SS Balance assertions
hledger supports Ledger\-style balance assertions in journal files.
These look like, for example, \f[CR]= EXPECTEDBALANCE\f[R] following a
posting\[aq]s amount.
Eg here we assert the expected dollar balance in accounts a and b after
each posting:
.IP
.EX
2013/1/1
  a   $1 =  $1
  b      = $\-1

2013/1/2
  a   $1 =  $2
  b  $\-1 = $\-2
.EE
.PP
After reading a journal file, hledger will check all balance assertions
and report an error if any of them fail.
Balance assertions can protect you from, eg, inadvertently disrupting
reconciled balances while cleaning up old entries.
You can disable them temporarily with the
\f[CR]\-I/\-\-ignore\-assertions\f[R] flag, which can be useful for
troubleshooting or for reading Ledger files.
(Note: this flag currently does not disable balance assignments,
described below).
.SS Assertions and ordering
hledger calculates and checks an account\[aq]s balance assertions in
date order (and when there are multiple assertions on the same day, in
parse order).
Note this is different from Ledger, which checks assertions always in
parse order, ignoring dates.
.PP
This means in hledger you can freely reorder transactions, postings, or
files, and balance assertions will usually keep working.
The exception is when you reorder multiple postings on the same day, to
the same account, which have balance assertions; those will likely need
updating.
.SS Assertions and multiple included files
Multiple files included with the \f[CR]include\f[R] directive are
processed as if concatenated into one file, preserving their order and
the posting order within each file.
It means that balance assertions in later files will see balance from
earlier files.
.PP
And if you have multiple postings to an account on the same day, split
across multiple files, and you want to assert the account\[aq]s balance
on that day, you\[aq]ll need to put the assertion in the right file \-
the last one in the sequence, probably.
.SS Assertions and multiple \-f files
Unlike \f[CR]include\f[R], when multiple files are specified on the
command line with multiple \f[CR]\-f/\-\-file\f[R] options, balance
assertions will not see balance from earlier files.
This can be useful when you do not want problems in earlier files to
disrupt valid assertions in later files.
.PP
If you do want assertions to see balance from earlier files, use
\f[CR]include\f[R], or concatenate the files temporarily.
.SS Assertions and costs
Balance assertions ignore costs, and should normally be written without
one:
.IP
.EX
2019/1/1
  (a)     $1 \[at] €1 = $1
.EE
.PP
We do allow costs to be written in balance assertion amounts, however,
and print shows them, but they don\[aq]t affect whether the assertion
passes or fails.
This is for backward compatibility (hledger\[aq]s close command used to
generate balance assertions with costs), and because balance
\f[I]assignments\f[R] do use costs (see below).
.SS Assertions and commodities
The balance assertions described so far are \[dq]\f[B]single commodity
balance assertions\f[R]\[dq]: they assert and check the balance in one
commodity, ignoring any others that may be present.
This is how balance assertions work in Ledger also.
.PP
If an account contains multiple commodities, you can assert their
balances by writing multiple postings with balance assertions, one for
each commodity:
.IP
.EX
2013/1/1
  usd   $\-1
  eur   €\-1
  both

2013/1/2
  both    0 = $1
  both    0 = €1
.EE
.PP
In hledger you can make a stronger \[dq]\f[B]sole commodity balance
assertion\f[R]\[dq] by writing two equals signs
(\f[CR]== EXPECTEDBALANCE\f[R]).
This also asserts that there are no other commodities in the account
besides the asserted one (or at least, that their current balance is
zero):
.IP
.EX
2013/1/1
  usd   $\-1  == $\-1  ; these sole commodity assertions succeed
  eur   €\-1  == €\-1
  both      ;==  $1  ; this one would fail because \[aq]both\[aq] contains $ and €
.EE
.PP
It\[aq]s less easy to make a \[dq]\f[B]sole commodities balance
assertion\f[R]\[dq] (note the plural) \- ie, asserting that an account
contains two or more specified commodities and no others.
It can be done by
.IP "1." 3
isolating each commodity in a subaccount, and asserting those
.IP "2." 3
and also asserting there are no commodities in the parent account
itself:
.IP
.EX
2013/1/1
  usd       $\-1
  eur       €\-1
  both        0 == 0   ; nothing up my sleeve
  both:usd   $1 == $1  ; a dollar here
  both:eur   €1 == €1  ; a euro there
.EE
.SS Assertions and subaccounts
All of the balance assertions above (both \f[CR]=\f[R] and
\f[CR]==\f[R]) are \[dq]\f[B]subaccount\-exclusive balance
assertions\f[R]\[dq]; they ignore any balances that exist in deeper
subaccounts.
.PP
In hledger you can make \[dq]\f[B]subaccount\-inclusive balance
assertions\f[R]\[dq] by adding a star after the equals (\f[CR]=*\f[R] or
\f[CR]==*\f[R]):
.IP
.EX
2019/1/1
  equity:start
  assets:checking  $10
  assets:savings   $10
  assets            $0 ==* $20  ; assets + subaccounts contains $20 and nothing else
.EE
.SS Assertions and virtual postings
Balance assertions always consider both real and virtual postings; they
are not affected by the \f[CR]\-\-real/\-R\f[R] flag or \f[CR]real:\f[R]
query.
.SS Assertions and auto postings
Balance assertions \f[I]are\f[R] affected by the \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R]
flag, which generates auto postings, which can alter account balances.
Because auto postings are optional in hledger, accounts affected by them
effectively have two balances.
But balance assertions can only test one or the other of these.
So to avoid making fragile assertions, either:
.IP \[bu] 2
assert the balance calculated with \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R], and always use
\f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R] with that file
.IP \[bu] 2
or assert the balance calculated without \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R], and never
use \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R] with that file
.IP \[bu] 2
or avoid balance assertions on accounts affected by auto postings (or
avoid auto postings entirely).
.SS Assertions and precision
Balance assertions compare the exactly calculated amounts, which are not
always what is shown by reports.
Eg a commodity directive may limit the display precision, but this will
not affect balance assertions.
Balance assertion failure messages show exact amounts.
.SS Posting comments
Text following \f[CR];\f[R], at the end of a posting line, and/or on
indented lines immediately below it, form comments for that posting.
They are reproduced by \f[CR]print\f[R] but otherwise ignored, except
they may contain tags, which are not ignored.
.IP
.EX
2012\-01\-01
    expenses   1  ; a comment for posting 1
    assets
    ; a comment for posting 2
    ; a second comment line for posting 2
.EE
.SS Transaction balancing
How exactly does hledger decide when a transaction is balanced ?
The general goal is that if you look at the journal entry and calculate
the amounts\[aq] sum perfectly with pencil and paper, hledger should
agree with you.
.PP
Real world transactions, especially for investments or cryptocurrencies,
often involve imprecise costs, complex decimals, and/or
infinitely\-recurring decimals, which are difficult or inconvenient to
handle on a computer.
So to be a practical accounting system, hledger allows some imprecision
when checking transaction balancedness.
The question is, how much imprecision should be allowed ?
.PP
hledger currently decides it based on the commodity display styles: if
the postings\[aq] sum would appear to be zero when displayed with the
standard display precisions, the transaction is considered balanced.
.PP
Or equivalently: if the journal entry is displayed with amounts rounded
to the standard display precisions (with
\f[CR]hledger print \-\-round=hard\f[R]), and a human with pencil and
paper would agree that those displayed amounts add up to zero, the
transaction is considered balanced.
.PP
This has some advantages: it is fairly intuitive, general not
hard\-coded, yet configurable when needed.
On the downside it means that transaction balancedness is related to
commodity display precisions, so eg when using
\f[CR]\-c/\-\-commodity\-style\f[R] to display things with more than
usual precision, you might need to fix some of your journal entries (ie,
add decimal digits to make them balance more precisely).
.PP
Other PTA tools (Ledger, Beancount..)
have their own ways of doing it.
Possible improvements are discussed at #1964.
.PP
Note: if you have multiple journal files, and are relying on commodity
directives to make imprecise journal entries balance, the
directives\[aq] placement might be important \- see \f[CR]commodity\f[R]
directive.
.SS Tags
Tags are a way to add extra labels or data fields to transactions,
postings, or accounts, which you can then search or pivot on.
.PP
A tag is a word, optionally hyphenated, immediately followed by a full
colon, in the comment of a transaction, a posting, or an account
directive.
Eg: \f[CR]2024\-01\-01 a transaction   ; foo:\f[R] Note this is an
exception to the usual rule that things in comments are ignored.
.PP
You can write multiple tags on one line, separated by comma.
Or you can write each tag on its own comment line (no comma needed in
this case).
.PP
For example, here are five different tags: one on the
\f[CR]assets:checking\f[R] account, two on the transaction, and two on
the \f[CR]expenses:food\f[R] posting:
.IP
.EX
account assets:checking         ; accounttag:

2017/1/16 bought groceries      ; transactiontag\-1:
    ; transactiontag\-2:
    assets:checking        $\-1
    expenses:food           $1  ; postingtag:, another\-posting\-tag:
.EE
.PP
Postings also inherit tags from their transaction and their account.
And transactions also acquire tags from their postings (and
postings\[aq] accounts).
So in the example above, the expenses posting effectively has all five
tags (by inheriting from the account and transaction), and the
transaction also has all five tags (by acquiring from the expenses
posting).
.SS Tag names
Most non\-whitespace characters are allowed in tag names.
Eg \f[CR]😀:\f[R] is a valid tag.
.PP
You can list the tag names used in your journal with the tags command:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]hledger tags [NAMEREGEX]\f[R]
.PP
In commands which use a query, you can match by tag name.
Eg:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]hledger print tag:NAMEREGEX\f[R]
.PP
You can declare valid tag names with the tag directive and then check
them with the check command.
.SS Special tags
Some tag names have special significance to hledger.
There\[aq]s not much harm in using them yourself, but some could produce
an error message, particularly the \f[CR]date:\f[R] and \f[CR]type:\f[R]
tags.
They are explained elsewhere, but here is a quick list for reference:
.PP
Tags you can set to influence hledger\[aq]s behaviour:
.IP
.EX
 date                   \-\- overrides a posting\[aq]s date
 date2                  \-\- overrides a posting\[aq]s secondary date
 type                   \-\- declares an account\[aq]s type
.EE
.PP
Tags hledger adds to indicate generated data:
.IP
.EX
 t                      \-\- appears on postings generated by timedot letters
 assert                 \-\- appears on txns generated by close \-\-assert
 retain                 \-\- appears on txns generated by close \-\-retain
 start                  \-\- appears on txns generated by close \-\-migrate/\-\-close/\-\-open/\-\-assign
 generated\-transaction  \-\- appears on generated periodic txns (with \-\-verbose\-tags)
 generated\-posting      \-\- appears on generated auto postings (with \-\-verbose\-tags)
 modified               \-\- appears on txns which have had auto postings added (with \-\-verbose\-tags)

Not displayed, but queryable:
 _generated\-transaction \-\- exists on generated periodic txns (always)
 _generated\-posting     \-\- exists on generated auto postings (always)
 _modified              \-\- exists on txns which have had auto postings added (always)
.EE
.PP
Other tags hledger uses internally:
.IP
.EX
 _cost\-matched          \-\- marks postings with a cost which have been matched with a nearby pair of equity conversion postings
 _conversion\-matched    \-\- marks equity conversion postings which have been matched with a nearby posting with a cost
.EE
.SS Tag values
Tags can have a value, which is any text after the colon up until a
comma or end of line, with surrounding whitespace removed.
Ending at comma allows us to write multiple tags on one line, but also
means that tag values can not contain commas.
.PP
Eg in the following posting, the three tags\[aq] values are \[dq]value
1\[dq], \[dq]value 2\[dq], and \[dq]\[dq] (empty) respectively:
.IP
.EX
    expenses:food   $10    ; foo, tag1: value 1 , tag2:value 2, bar tag3: , baz
.EE
.PP
Multiple tags with the same name are additive rather than overriding:
when the same tag name is seen again with a new value, the new
name:value pair is added to the tags.
It is not possible to override a previous tag\[aq]s value or remove a
tag.
.PP
You can list all the values used for a particular tag in the journal
with
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]hledger tags TAGNAME \-\-values\f[R]
.PP
You can match on tag values with a query like
\f[CR]tag:NAMEREGEX=VALUEREGEX\f[R]
.SS Directives
Besides transactions, there is something else you can put in a
\f[CR]journal\f[R] file: directives.
These are declarations, beginning with a keyword, that modify
hledger\[aq]s behaviour.
Some directives can have more specific subdirectives, indented below
them.
hledger\[aq]s directives are similar to Ledger\[aq]s in many cases, but
there are also many differences.
Directives are not required, but can be useful.
Here are the main directives:

.SS Directives and multiple files
Directives vary in their scope, ie which journal entries and which input
files they affect.
Most often, a directive will affect the following entries and included
files if any, until the end of the current file \- and no further.
You might find this inconvenient!
For example, \f[CR]alias\f[R] directives do not affect parent or sibling
files.
But there are usually workarounds; for example, put \f[CR]alias\f[R]
directives in your top\-most file, before including other files.
.PP
The restriction, though it may be annoying at first, is in a good cause;
it allows reports to be stable and deterministic, independent of the
order of input.
Without it, reports could show different numbers depending on the order
of \-f options, or the positions of include directives in your files.
.SS Directive effects
Here are all hledger\[aq]s directives, with their effects and scope
summarised \- nine main directives, plus four others which we consider
non\-essential:

.TE
.SS \f[CR]account\f[R] directive
\f[CR]account\f[R] directives can be used to declare accounts (ie, the
places that amounts are transferred from and to).
Though not required, these declarations can provide several benefits:
.IP \[bu] 2
They can document your intended chart of accounts, providing a
reference.
.IP \[bu] 2
They can store additional account information as comments, or as tags
which can be used to filter or pivot reports.
.IP \[bu] 2
They can restrict which accounts may be posted to by transactions, eg in
strict mode, which helps prevent errors.
.IP \[bu] 2
They influence account display order in reports, allowing
non\-alphabetic sorting (eg Revenues to appear above Expenses).
.IP \[bu] 2
They can help hledger know your accounts\[aq] types (asset, liability,
equity, revenue, expense), enabling reports like balancesheet and
incomestatement.
.IP \[bu] 2
They help with account name completion (in hledger add, hledger\-web,
hledger\-iadd, ledger\-mode, etc.)
.PP
They are written as the word \f[CR]account\f[R] followed by a
hledger\-style account name.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
account assets:bank:checking
.EE
.PP
Ledger\-style indented subdirectives are also accepted, but ignored:
.IP
.EX
account assets:bank:checking
  format subdirective  ; currently ignored
.EE
.SS Account comments
Text following \f[B]two or more spaces\f[R] and \f[CR];\f[R] at the end
of an account directive line, and/or following \f[CR];\f[R] on indented
lines immediately below it, form comments for that account.
They are ignored except they may contain tags, which are not ignored.
.PP
The two\-space requirement for same\-line account comments is because
\f[CR];\f[R] is allowed in account names.
.IP
.EX
account assets:bank:checking    ; same\-line comment, at least 2 spaces before the semicolon
  ; next\-line comment
  ; some tags \- type:A, acctnum:12345
.EE
.SS Account error checking
By default, accounts need not be declared; they come into existence when
a posting references them.
This is convenient, but it means hledger can\[aq]t warn you when you
mis\-spell an account name in the journal.
Usually you\[aq]ll find that error later, as an extra account in balance
reports, or an incorrect balance when reconciling.
.PP
In strict mode, enabled with the \f[CR]\-s\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-strict\f[R]
flag, or when you run \f[CR]hledger check accounts\f[R], hledger will
report an error if any transaction uses an account name that has not
been declared by an account directive.
Some notes:
.IP \[bu] 2
The declaration is case\-sensitive; transactions must use the correct
account name capitalisation.
.IP \[bu] 2
The account directive\[aq]s scope is \[dq]whole file and below\[dq] (see
directives).
This means it affects all of the current file, and any files it
includes, but not parent or sibling files.
The position of account directives within the file does not matter,
though it\[aq]s usual to put them at the top.
.IP \[bu] 2
Accounts can only be declared in \f[CR]journal\f[R] files, but will
affect included files of all types.
.IP \[bu] 2
It\[aq]s currently not possible to declare \[dq]all possible
subaccounts\[dq] with a wildcard; every account posted to must be
declared.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you use the \-\-infer\-equity flag, you will also need declarations
for the account names it generates.
.SS Account display order
Account directives also cause hledger to display accounts in a
particular order, not just alphabetically.
Eg, here is a conventional ordering for the top\-level accounts:
.IP
.EX
account assets
account liabilities
account equity
account revenues
account expenses
.EE
.PP
Now hledger displays them in that order:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger accounts
assets
liabilities
equity
revenues
expenses
.EE
.PP
If there are undeclared accounts, those will be displayed last, in
alphabetical order.
.PP
Sorting is done within each group of sibling accounts, at each level of
the account tree.
Eg, a declaration like \f[CR]account parent:child\f[R] influences
\f[CR]child\f[R]\[aq]s position among its siblings.
.PP
Note, it does not affect \f[CR]parent\f[R]\[aq]s position; for that, you
need an \f[CR]account parent\f[R] declaration.
.PP
Sibling accounts are always displayed together; hledger won\[aq]t
display \f[CR]x:y\f[R] in between \f[CR]a:b\f[R] and \f[CR]a:c\f[R].
.PP
An account directive both declares an account as a valid posting target,
and declares its display order; you can\[aq]t easily do one without the
other.
.SS Account types
hledger knows that accounts come in several types: assets, liabilities,
expenses and so on.
This enables easy reports like balancesheet and incomestatement, and
filtering by account type with the \f[CR]type:\f[R] query.
.PP
As a convenience, hledger will detect these account types automatically
if you are using common english\-language top\-level account names
(described below).
But it\[aq]s more robust to declare accounts\[aq] types explicitly, by
adding \f[CR]type:\f[R] tags to their account directives.
The tag\[aq]s value should be one of the five main account types:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]A\f[R] or \f[CR]Asset\f[R] (things you own)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]L\f[R] or \f[CR]Liability\f[R] (things you owe)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]E\f[R] or \f[CR]Equity\f[R] (investment/ownership; balanced
counterpart of assets & liabilities)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]R\f[R] or \f[CR]Revenue\f[R] (what you received money from, AKA
income; technically part of Equity)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]X\f[R] or \f[CR]Expense\f[R] (what you spend money on; technically
part of Equity)
.PP
or, it can be (these are used less often):
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]C\f[R] or \f[CR]Cash\f[R] (a subtype of Asset, indicating liquid
assets for the cashflow report)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]V\f[R] or \f[CR]Conversion\f[R] (a subtype of Equity, for
conversions (see Cost reporting).)
.PP
Subaccounts inherit their parent\[aq]s type, or they can override it.
Here is a typical set of account type declarations:
.IP
.EX
account assets             ; type: A
account liabilities        ; type: L
account equity             ; type: E
account revenues           ; type: R
account expenses           ; type: X

account assets:bank        ; type: C
account assets:cash        ; type: C

account equity:conversion  ; type: V
.EE
.PP
Here are some tips for working with account types.
.IP \[bu] 2
The rules for inferring types from account names are as follows.
These are just a convenience that sometimes help new users get going; if
they don\[aq]t work for you, just ignore them and declare your account
types.
See also Regular expressions.
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
If account\[aq]s name contains this (CI) regular expression:            | its type is:
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\[ha]assets?(:.+)?:(cash|bank|che(ck|que?)(ing)?|savings?|current)(:|$) | Cash
\[ha]assets?(:|$)                                                       | Asset
\[ha](debts?|liabilit(y|ies))(:|$)                                      | Liability
\[ha]equity:(trad(e|ing)|conversion)s?(:|$)                             | Conversion
\[ha]equity(:|$)                                                        | Equity
\[ha](income|revenue)s?(:|$)                                            | Revenue
\[ha]expenses?(:|$)                                                     | Expense
.EE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
If you declare any account types, it\[aq]s a good idea to declare an
account for all of the account types, because a mixture of declared and
name\-inferred types can disrupt certain reports.
.IP \[bu] 2
Certain uses of account aliases can disrupt account types.
See Rewriting accounts > Aliases and account types.
.IP \[bu] 2
As mentioned above, subaccounts will inherit a type from their parent
account.
More precisely, an account\[aq]s type is decided by the first of these
that exists:
.RS 2
.IP "1." 3
A \f[CR]type:\f[R] declaration for this account.
.IP "2." 3
A \f[CR]type:\f[R] declaration in the parent accounts above it,
preferring the nearest.
.IP "3." 3
An account type inferred from this account\[aq]s name.
.IP "4." 3
An account type inferred from a parent account\[aq]s name, preferring
the nearest parent.
.IP "5." 3
Otherwise, it will have no type.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
For troubleshooting, you can list accounts and their types with:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
$ hledger accounts \-\-types [ACCTPAT] [\-DEPTH] [type:TYPECODES]
.EE
.RE
.SS \f[CR]alias\f[R] directive
You can define account alias rules which rewrite your account names, or
parts of them, before generating reports.
This can be useful for:
.IP \[bu] 2
expanding shorthand account names to their full form, allowing easier
data entry and a less verbose journal
.IP \[bu] 2
adapting old journals to your current chart of accounts
.IP \[bu] 2
experimenting with new account organisations, like a new hierarchy
.IP \[bu] 2
combining two accounts into one, eg to see their sum or difference on
one line
.IP \[bu] 2
customising reports
.PP
Account aliases also rewrite account names in account directives.
They do not affect account names being entered via hledger add or
hledger\-web.
.PP
Account aliases are very powerful.
They are generally easy to use correctly, but you can also generate
invalid account names with them; more on this below.
.PP
See also Rewrite account names.
.SS Basic aliases
To set an account alias, use the \f[CR]alias\f[R] directive in your
journal file.
This affects all subsequent journal entries in the current file or its
included files (but note: not sibling or parent files).
The spaces around the = are optional:
.IP
.EX
alias OLD = NEW
.EE
.PP
Or, you can use the \f[CR]\-\-alias \[aq]OLD=NEW\[aq]\f[R] option on the
command line.
This affects all entries.
It\[aq]s useful for trying out aliases interactively.
.PP
OLD and NEW are case sensitive full account names.
hledger will replace any occurrence of the old account name with the new
one.
Subaccounts are also affected.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
alias checking = assets:bank:wells fargo:checking
; rewrites \[dq]checking\[dq] to \[dq]assets:bank:wells fargo:checking\[dq], or \[dq]checking:a\[dq] to \[dq]assets:bank:wells fargo:checking:a\[dq]
.EE
.SS Regex aliases
There is also a more powerful variant that uses a regular expression,
indicated by wrapping the pattern in forward slashes.
(This is the only place where hledger requires forward slashes around a
regular expression.)
.PP
Eg:
.IP
.EX
alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT
.EE
.PP
or:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-\-alias \[aq]/REGEX/=REPLACEMENT\[aq] ...
.EE
.PP
Any part of an account name matched by REGEX will be replaced by
REPLACEMENT.
REGEX is case\-insensitive as usual.
.PP
If you need to match a forward slash, escape it with a backslash, eg
\f[CR]/\[rs]/=:\f[R].
.PP
If REGEX contains parenthesised match groups, these can be referenced by
the usual backslash and number in REPLACEMENT:
.IP
.EX
alias /\[ha](.+):bank:([\[ha]:]+):(.*)/ = \[rs]1:\[rs]2 \[rs]3
; rewrites \[dq]assets:bank:wells fargo:checking\[dq] to  \[dq]assets:wells fargo checking\[dq]
.EE
.PP
REPLACEMENT continues to the end of line (or on command line, to end of
option argument), so it can contain trailing whitespace.
.SS Combining aliases
You can define as many aliases as you like, using journal directives
and/or command line options.
.PP
Recursive aliases \- where an account name is rewritten by one alias,
then by another alias, and so on \- are allowed.
Each alias sees the effect of previously applied aliases.
.PP
In such cases it can be important to understand which aliases will be
applied and in which order.
For (each account name in) each journal entry, we apply:
.IP "1." 3
\f[CR]alias\f[R] directives preceding the journal entry, most recently
parsed first (ie, reading upward from the journal entry, bottom to top)
.IP "2." 3
\f[CR]\-\-alias\f[R] options, in the order they appeared on the command
line (left to right).
.PP
In other words, for (an account name in) a given journal entry:
.IP \[bu] 2
the nearest alias declaration before/above the entry is applied first
.IP \[bu] 2
the next alias before/above that will be be applied next, and so on
.IP \[bu] 2
aliases defined after/below the entry do not affect it.
.PP
This gives nearby aliases precedence over distant ones, and helps
provide semantic stability \- aliases will keep working the same way
independent of which files are being read and in which order.
.PP
In case of trouble, adding \f[CR]\-\-debug=6\f[R] to the command line
will show which aliases are being applied when.
.SS Aliases and multiple files
As explained at Directives and multiple files, \f[CR]alias\f[R]
directives do not affect parent or sibling files.
Eg in this command,
.IP
.EX
hledger \-f a.aliases \-f b.journal
.EE
.PP
account aliases defined in a.aliases will not affect b.journal.
Including the aliases doesn\[aq]t work either:
.IP
.EX
include a.aliases

2023\-01\-01  ; not affected by a.aliases
  foo  1
  bar
.EE
.PP
This means that account aliases should usually be declared at the start
of your top\-most file, like this:
.IP
.EX
alias foo=Foo
alias bar=Bar

2023\-01\-01  ; affected by aliases above
  foo  1
  bar

include c.journal  ; also affected
.EE
.SS \f[CR]end aliases\f[R] directive
You can clear (forget) all currently defined aliases (seen in the
journal so far, or defined on the command line) with this directive:
.IP
.EX
end aliases
.EE
.SS Aliases can generate bad account names
Be aware that account aliases can produce malformed account names, which
could cause confusing reports or invalid \f[CR]print\f[R] output.
For example, you could erase all account names:
.IP
.EX
2021\-01\-01
  a:aa     1
  b
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-alias \[aq]/.*/=\[aq]
2021\-01\-01
                   1
.EE
.PP
The above \f[CR]print\f[R] output is not a valid journal.
Or you could insert an illegal double space, causing \f[CR]print\f[R]
output that would give a different journal when reparsed:
.IP
.EX
2021\-01\-01
  old    1
  other
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-alias old=\[dq]new  USD\[dq] | hledger \-f\- print
2021\-01\-01
    new             USD 1
    other
.EE
.SS Aliases and account types
If an account with a type declaration (see Declaring accounts > Account
types) is renamed by an alias, normally the account type remains in
effect.
.PP
However, renaming in a way that reshapes the account tree (eg renaming
parent accounts but not their children, or vice versa) could prevent
child accounts from inheriting the account type of their parents.
.PP
Secondly, if an account\[aq]s type is being inferred from its name,
renaming it by an alias could prevent or alter that.
.PP
If you are using account aliases and the \f[CR]type:\f[R] query is not
matching accounts as you expect, try troubleshooting with the accounts
command, eg something like:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger accounts \-\-alias assets=bassetts type:a
.EE
.SS \f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive
The \f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive performs several functions:
.IP "1." 3
It declares which commodity symbols may be used in the journal, enabling
useful error checking with strict mode or the check command.
See Commodity error checking below.
.IP "2." 3
It declares how all amounts in this commodity should be displayed, eg
how many decimals to show.
See Commodity display style above.
.IP "3." 3
(If no \f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R] directive is in effect:) It sets the
decimal mark to expect (period or comma) when parsing amounts in this
commodity, in this file and files it includes, from the directive until
end of current file.
See Decimal marks above.
.IP "4." 3
It declares the precision with which this commodity\[aq]s amounts should
be compared when checking for balanced transactions, anywhere in this
file and files it includes, until end of current file.
.PP
Declaring commodities solves several common parsing/display problems, so
we recommend it.
.PP
Note that effects 3 and 4 above end at the end of the directive\[aq]s
file, and will not affect sibling or parent files.
So if you are relying on them (especially 4) and using multiple files,
placing your commodity directives in a top\-level parent file might be
important.
Or, keep your decimal marks unambiguous and your entries well balanced
and precise.
.PP
(Related: #793)
.SS Commodity directive syntax
A commodity directive is normally the word \f[CR]commodity\f[R] followed
by a sample amount (and optionally a comment).
Only the amount\[aq]s symbol and format is significant.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
commodity $1000.00
commodity 1.000,00 EUR
commodity 1 000 000.0000   ; the no\-symbol commodity
.EE
.PP
Commodities do not have tags (tags in the comment will be ignored).
.PP
A commodity directive\[aq]s sample amount must always include a period
or comma decimal mark (this rule helps disambiguate decimal marks and
digit group marks).
If you don\[aq]t want to show any decimal digits, write the decimal mark
at the end:
.IP
.EX
commodity 1000. AAAA       ; show AAAA with no decimals
.EE
.PP
Commodity symbols containing spaces, numbers, or punctuation must be
enclosed in double quotes, as usual:
.IP
.EX
commodity 1.0000 \[dq]AAAA 2023\[dq]
.EE
.PP
Commodity directives normally include a sample amount, but can declare
only a symbol (ie, just function 1 above):
.IP
.EX
commodity $
commodity INR
commodity \[dq]AAAA 2023\[dq]
commodity \[dq]\[dq]               ; the no\-symbol commodity
.EE
.PP
Commodity directives may also be written with an indented
\f[CR]format\f[R] subdirective, as in Ledger.
The symbol is repeated and must be the same in both places.
Other subdirectives are currently ignored:
.IP
.EX
; display indian rupees with currency name on the left,
; thousands, lakhs and crores comma\-separated,
; period as decimal point, and two decimal places.
commodity INR
  format INR 1,00,00,000.00
  an unsupported subdirective  ; ignored by hledger
.EE
.SS Commodity error checking
In strict mode (\f[CR]\-s\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-strict\f[R]) (or when you run
\f[CR]hledger check commodities\f[R]), hledger will report an error if
an undeclared commodity symbol is used.
(With one exception: zero amounts are always allowed to have no
commodity symbol.)
It works like account error checking (described above).
.SS \f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R] directive
You can use a \f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R] directive \- usually one per
file, at the top of the file \- to declare which character represents a
decimal mark when parsing amounts in this file.
It can look like
.IP
.EX
decimal\-mark .
.EE
.PP
or
.IP
.EX
decimal\-mark ,
.EE
.PP
This prevents any ambiguity when parsing numbers in the file, so we
recommend it, especially if the file contains digit group marks (eg
thousands separators).
.SS \f[CR]include\f[R] directive
You can pull in the content of additional files by writing an include
directive, like this:
.IP
.EX
include FILEPATH
.EE
.PP
Only journal files can include, and only journal, timeclock or timedot
files can be included (not CSV files, currently).
.PP
If the file path does not begin with a slash, it is relative to the
current file\[aq]s folder.
.PP
A tilde means home directory, eg: \f[CR]include \[ti]/main.journal\f[R].
.PP
The path may contain glob patterns to match multiple files, eg:
\f[CR]include *.journal\f[R].
.PP
There is limited support for recursive wildcards: \f[CR]**/\f[R] (the
slash is required) matches 0 or more subdirectories.
It\[aq]s not super convenient since you have to avoid include cycles and
including directories, but this can be done, eg:
\f[CR]include */**/*.journal\f[R].
.PP
The path may also be prefixed to force a specific file format,
overriding the file extension (as described in Data formats):
\f[CR]include timedot:\[ti]/notes/2023*.md\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]P\f[R] directive
The \f[CR]P\f[R] directive declares a market price, which is a
conversion rate between two commodities on a certain date.
This allows value reports to convert amounts of one commodity to their
value in another, on or after that date.
These prices are often obtained from a stock exchange, cryptocurrency
exchange, the or foreign exchange market.
.PP
The format is:
.IP
.EX
P DATE COMMODITY1SYMBOL COMMODITY2AMOUNT
.EE
.PP
DATE is a simple date, COMMODITY1SYMBOL is the symbol of the commodity
being priced, and COMMODITY2AMOUNT is the amount (symbol and quantity)
of commodity 2 that one unit of commodity 1 is worth on this date.
Examples:
.IP
.EX
# one euro was worth $1.35 from 2009\-01\-01 onward:
P 2009\-01\-01 € $1.35

# and $1.40 from 2010\-01\-01 onward:
P 2010\-01\-01 € $1.40
.EE
.PP
The \f[CR]\-V\f[R], \f[CR]\-X\f[R] and \f[CR]\-\-value\f[R] flags use
these market prices to show amount values in another commodity.
See Value reporting.
.PP
.SS \f[CR]payee\f[R] directive
\f[CR]payee PAYEE NAME\f[R]
.PP
This directive can be used to declare a limited set of payees which may
appear in transaction descriptions.
The \[dq]payees\[dq] check will report an error if any transaction
refers to a payee that has not been declared.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
payee Whole Foods    ; a comment
.EE
.PP
Payees do not have tags (tags in the comment will be ignored).
.PP
To declare the empty payee name, use \f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R].
.IP
.EX
payee \[dq]\[dq]
.EE
.PP
Ledger\-style indented subdirectives, if any, are currently ignored.
.SS \f[CR]tag\f[R] directive
\f[CR]tag TAGNAME\f[R]
.PP
This directive can be used to declare a limited set of tag names allowed
in tags.
TAGNAME should be a valid tag name (no spaces).
Eg:
.IP
.EX
tag  item\-id
.EE
.PP
Any indented subdirectives are currently ignored.
.PP
The \[dq]tags\[dq] check will report an error if any undeclared tag name
is used.
It is quite easy to accidentally create a tag through normal use of
colons in comments; if you want to prevent this, you can declare and
check your tags .
.SS Periodic transactions
The \f[CR]\[ti]\f[R] directive declares a \[dq]periodic rule\[dq] which
generates temporary extra transactions, usually recurring at some
interval, when hledger is run with the \f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R] flag.
These \[dq]forecast transactions\[dq] are useful for forecasting future
activity.
They exist only for the duration of the report, and only when
\f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R] is used; they are not saved in the journal file
by hledger.
.PP
Periodic rules also have a second use: with the \f[CR]\-\-budget\f[R]
flag they set budget goals for budgeting.
.PP
Periodic rules can be a little tricky, so before you use them, read this
whole section, or at least the following tips:
.IP "1." 3
Two spaces accidentally added or omitted will cause you trouble \- read
about this below.
.IP "2." 3
For troubleshooting, show the generated transactions with
\f[CR]hledger print \-\-forecast tag:generated\f[R] or
\f[CR]hledger register \-\-forecast tag:generated\f[R].
.IP "3." 3
Forecasted transactions will begin only after the last non\-forecasted
transaction\[aq]s date.
.IP "4." 3
Forecasted transactions will end 6 months from today, by default.
See below for the exact start/end rules.
.IP "5." 3
period expressions can be tricky.
Their documentation needs improvement, but is worth studying.
.IP "6." 3
Some period expressions with a repeating interval must begin on a
natural boundary of that interval.
Eg in \f[CR]weekly from DATE\f[R], DATE must be a monday.
\f[CR]\[ti] weekly from 2019/10/1\f[R] (a tuesday) will give an error.
.IP "7." 3
Other period expressions with an interval are automatically expanded to
cover a whole number of that interval.
(This is done to improve reports, but it also affects periodic
transactions.
Yes, it\[aq]s a bit inconsistent with the above.)
Eg:  \f[CR]\[ti] every 10th day of month from 2023/01\f[R], which is
equivalent to  \f[CR]\[ti] every 10th day of month from 2023/01/01\f[R],
will be adjusted to start on 2019/12/10.
.SS Periodic rule syntax
A periodic transaction rule looks like a normal journal entry, with the
date replaced by a tilde (\f[CR]\[ti]\f[R]) followed by a period
expression (mnemonic: \f[CR]\[ti]\f[R] looks like a recurring sine
wave.):
.IP
.EX
# every first of month
\[ti] monthly
    expenses:rent          $2000
    assets:bank:checking

# every 15th of month in 2023\[aq]s first quarter:
\[ti] monthly from 2023\-04\-15 to 2023\-06\-16
    expenses:utilities          $400
    assets:bank:checking
.EE
.PP
The period expression is the same syntax used for specifying
multi\-period reports, just interpreted differently; there, it specifies
report periods; here it specifies recurrence dates (the periods\[aq]
start dates).
.SS Periodic rules and relative dates
Partial or relative dates (like \f[CR]12/31\f[R], \f[CR]25\f[R],
\f[CR]tomorrow\f[R], \f[CR]last week\f[R], \f[CR]next quarter\f[R]) are
usually not recommended in periodic rules, since the results will change
as time passes.
If used, they will be interpreted relative to, in order of preference:
.IP "1." 3
the first day of the default year specified by a recent \f[CR]Y\f[R]
directive
.IP "2." 3
or the date specified with \f[CR]\-\-today\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
or the date on which you are running the report.
.PP
They will not be affected at all by report period or forecast period
dates.
.SS Two spaces between period expression and description!
If the period expression is followed by a transaction description, these
must be separated by \f[B]two or more spaces\f[R].
This helps hledger know where the period expression ends, so that
descriptions can not accidentally alter their meaning, as in this
example:
.IP
.EX
; 2 or more spaces needed here, so the period is not understood as \[dq]every 2 months in 2023\[dq]
;               ||
;               vv
\[ti] every 2 months  in 2023, we will review
    assets:bank:checking   $1500
    income:acme inc
.EE
.PP
So,
.IP \[bu] 2
Do write two spaces between your period expression and your transaction
description, if any.
.IP \[bu] 2
Don\[aq]t accidentally write two spaces in the middle of your period
expression.
.SS Auto postings
The \f[CR]=\f[R] directive declares an \[dq]auto posting rule\[dq],
which adds extra postings to existing transactions.
(Remember, postings are the account name & amount lines below a
transaction\[aq]s date & description.)
.PP
In the journal, an auto posting rule looks quite like a transaction, but
instead of date and description it has \f[CR]=\f[R] (mnemonic:
\[dq]match\[dq]) and a query, like this:
.IP
.EX
= QUERY
    ACCOUNT    AMOUNT
    ...
.EE
.PP
Queries are just like command line queries; an account name substring is
most common.
Query terms containing spaces should be enclosed in single or double
quotes.
.PP
Each \f[CR]=\f[R] rule works like this: when hledger is run with the
\f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R] flag, wherever the QUERY matches a posting in the
journal, the rule\[aq]s postings are added to that transaction,
immediately below the matched posting.
Note these generated postings are temporary, existing only for the
duration of the report, and only when \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R] is used; they
are not saved in the journal file by hledger.
.PP
Generated postings\[aq] amounts can depend on the matched posting\[aq]s
amount.
So auto postings can be useful for, eg, adding tax postings with a
standard percentage.
AMOUNT can be:
.IP \[bu] 2
a number with no commodity symbol, like \f[CR]2\f[R].
The matched posting\[aq]s commodity symbol will be added to this.
.IP \[bu] 2
a normal amount with a commodity symbol, like \f[CR]$2\f[R].
This will be used as\-is.
.IP \[bu] 2
an asterisk followed by a number, like \f[CR]*2\f[R].
This will multiply the matched posting\[aq]s amount (and total price, if
any) by the number.
.IP \[bu] 2
an asterisk followed by an amount with commodity symbol, like
\f[CR]*$2\f[R].
This multiplies and also replaces the commodity symbol with this new
one.
.PP
Some examples:
.IP
.EX
; every time I buy food, schedule a dollar donation
= expenses:food
    (liabilities:charity)   $\-1

; when I buy a gift, also deduct that amount from a budget envelope subaccount
= expenses:gifts
    assets:checking:gifts  *\-1
    assets:checking         *1

2017/12/1
  expenses:food    $10
  assets:checking

2017/12/14
  expenses:gifts   $20
  assets:checking
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-auto
2017\-12\-01
    expenses:food              $10
    assets:checking
    (liabilities:charity)      $\-1

2017\-12\-14
    expenses:gifts             $20
    assets:checking
    assets:checking:gifts     \-$20
    assets:checking            $20
.EE
.PP
Note that depending fully on generated data such as this has some
drawbacks \- it\[aq]s less portable, less future\-proof, less auditable
by others, and less robust (eg your balance assertions will depend on
whether you use or don\[aq]t use \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R]).
An alternative is to use auto postings in \[dq]one time\[dq] fashion \-
use them to help build a complex journal entry, view it with
\f[CR]hledger print \-\-auto\f[R], and then copy that output into the
journal file to make it permanent.
.SS Auto postings and multiple files
An auto posting rule can affect any transaction in the current file, or
in any parent file or child file.
Note, currently it will not affect sibling files (when multiple
\f[CR]\-f\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-file\f[R] are used \- see #1212).
.SS Auto postings and dates
A posting date (or secondary date) in the matched posting, or (taking
precedence) a posting date in the auto posting rule itself, will also be
used in the generated posting.
.SS Auto postings and transaction balancing / inferred amounts / balance assertions
Currently, auto postings are added:
.IP \[bu] 2
after missing amounts are inferred, and transactions are checked for
balancedness,
.IP \[bu] 2
but before balance assertions are checked.
.PP
Note this means that journal entries must be balanced both before and
after auto postings are added.
This changed in hledger 1.12+; see #893 for background.
.PP
This also means that you cannot have more than one auto\-posting with a
missing amount applied to a given transaction, as it will be unable to
infer amounts.
.SS Auto posting tags
Automated postings will have some extra tags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]generated\-posting:= QUERY\f[R] \- shows this was generated by an
auto posting rule, and the query
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]_generated\-posting:= QUERY\f[R] \- a hidden tag, which does not
appear in hledger\[aq]s output.
This can be used to match postings generated \[dq]just now\[dq], rather
than generated in the past and saved to the journal.
.PP
Also, any transaction that has been changed by auto posting rules will
have these tags added:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]modified:\f[R] \- this transaction was modified
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]_modified:\f[R] \- a hidden tag not appearing in the comment; this
transaction was modified \[dq]just now\[dq].
.SS Auto postings on forecast transactions only
Tip: you can can make auto postings that will apply to forecast
transactions but not recorded transactions, by adding
\f[CR]tag:_generated\-transaction\f[R] to their QUERY.
This can be useful when generating new journal entries to be saved in
the journal.
.SS Other syntax
hledger journal format supports quite a few other features, mainly to
make interoperating with or converting from Ledger easier.
Note some of the features below are powerful and can be useful in
special cases, but in general, features in this section are considered
less important or even not recommended for most users.
Downsides are mentioned to help you decide if you want to use them.
.SS Balance assignments
Ledger\-style balance assignments are also supported.
These are like balance assertions, but with no posting amount on the
left side of the equals sign; instead it is calculated automatically so
as to satisfy the assertion.
This can be a convenience during data entry, eg when setting opening
balances:
.IP
.EX
; starting a new journal, set asset account balances
2016/1/1 opening balances
  assets:checking            = $409.32
  assets:savings             = $735.24
  assets:cash                 = $42
  equity:opening balances
.EE
.PP
or when adjusting a balance to reality:
.IP
.EX
; no cash left; update balance, record any untracked spending as a generic expense
2016/1/15
  assets:cash    = $0
  expenses:misc
.EE
.PP
The calculated amount depends on the account\[aq]s balance in the
commodity at that point (which depends on the previously\-dated postings
of the commodity to that account since the last balance assertion or
assignment).
.PP
Downsides: using balance assignments makes your journal less explicit;
to know the exact amount posted, you have to run hledger or do the
calculations yourself, instead of just reading it.
Also balance assignments\[aq] forcing of balances can hide errors.
These things make your financial data less portable, less future\-proof,
and less trustworthy in an audit.
.SS Balance assignments and costs
A cost in a balance assignment will cause the calculated amount to have
that cost attached:
.IP
.EX
2019/1/1
  (a)             = $1 \[at] €2
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-explicit
2019\-01\-01
    (a)         $1 \[at] €2 = $1 \[at] €2
.EE
.SS Balance assignments and multiple files
Balance assignments handle multiple files like balance assertions.
They see balance from other files previously included from the current
file, but not from previous sibling or parent files.
.SS Bracketed posting dates
For setting posting dates and secondary posting dates, Ledger\[aq]s
bracketed date syntax is also supported: \f[CR][DATE]\f[R],
\f[CR][DATE=DATE2]\f[R] or \f[CR][=DATE2]\f[R] in posting comments.
hledger will attempt to parse any square\-bracketed sequence of the
\f[CR]0123456789/\-.=\f[R] characters in this way.
With this syntax, DATE infers its year from the transaction and DATE2
infers its year from DATE.
.PP
Downsides: another syntax to learn, redundant with hledger\[aq]s
\f[CR]date:\f[R]/\f[CR]date2:\f[R] tags, and confusingly similar to
Ledger\[aq]s lot date syntax.
.SS \f[CR]D\f[R] directive
\f[CR]D AMOUNT\f[R]
.PP
This directive sets a default commodity, to be used for any subsequent
commodityless amounts (ie, plain numbers) seen while parsing the
journal.
This effect lasts until the next \f[CR]D\f[R] directive, or the end of
the current file.
.PP
For compatibility/historical reasons, \f[CR]D\f[R] also acts like a
\f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive (setting the commodity\[aq]s decimal mark
for parsing and display style for output).
So its argument is not just a commodity symbol, but a full amount
demonstrating the style.
The amount must include a decimal mark (either period or comma).
Eg:
.IP
.EX
; commodity\-less amounts should be treated as dollars
; (and displayed with the dollar sign on the left, thousands separators and two decimal places)
D $1,000.00

1/1
  a     5  ; <\- commodity\-less amount, parsed as $5 and displayed as $5.00
  b
.EE
.PP
Interactions with other directives:
.PP
For setting a commodity\[aq]s display style, a \f[CR]commodity\f[R]
directive has highest priority, then a \f[CR]D\f[R] directive.
.PP
For detecting a commodity\[aq]s decimal mark during parsing,
\f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R] has highest priority, then
\f[CR]commodity\f[R], then \f[CR]D\f[R].
.PP
For checking commodity symbols with the check command, a
\f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive is required
(\f[CR]hledger check commodities\f[R] ignores \f[CR]D\f[R] directives).
.PP
Downsides: omitting commodity symbols makes your financial data less
explicit, less portable, and less trustworthy in an audit.
It is usually an unsustainable shortcut; sooner or later you will want
to track multiple commodities.
D is overloaded with functions redundant with \f[CR]commodity\f[R] and
\f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R].
And it works differently from Ledger\[aq]s \f[CR]D\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]apply account\f[R] directive
This directive sets a default parent account, which will be prepended to
all accounts in following entries, until an \f[CR]end apply account\f[R]
directive or end of current file.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
apply account home

2010/1/1
    food    $10
    cash

end apply account
.EE
.PP
is equivalent to:
.IP
.EX
2010/01/01
    home:food           $10
    home:cash          $\-10
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]account\f[R] directives are also affected, and so is any
\f[CR]include\f[R]d content.
.PP
Account names entered via hledger add or hledger\-web are not affected.
.PP
Account aliases, if any, are applied after the parent account is
prepended.
.PP
Downsides: this can make your financial data less explicit, less
portable, and less trustworthy in an audit.
.SS \f[CR]Y\f[R] directive
\f[CR]Y YEAR\f[R]
.PP
or (deprecated backward\-compatible forms):
.PP
\f[CR]year YEAR\f[R] \f[CR]apply year YEAR\f[R]
.PP
The space is optional.
This sets a default year to be used for subsequent dates which don\[aq]t
specify a year.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
Y2009  ; set default year to 2009

12/15  ; equivalent to 2009/12/15
  expenses  1
  assets

year 2010  ; change default year to 2010

2009/1/30  ; specifies the year, not affected
  expenses  1
  assets

1/31   ; equivalent to 2010/1/31
  expenses  1
  assets
.EE
.PP
Downsides: omitting the year (from primary transaction dates, at least)
makes your financial data less explicit, less portable, and less
trustworthy in an audit.
Such dates can get separated from their corresponding Y directive, eg
when evaluating a region of the journal in your editor.
A missing Y directive makes reports dependent on today\[aq]s date.
.SS Secondary dates
A secondary date is written after the primary date, following an equals
sign: \f[CR]DATE1=DATE2\f[R].
If the year is omitted, the primary date\[aq]s year is assumed.
When running reports, the primary (left side) date is used by default,
but with the \f[CR]\-\-date2\f[R] flag (\f[CR]\-\-aux\-date\f[R]
or\f[CR]\-\-effective\f[R] also work, for Ledger users), the secondary
(right side) date will be used instead.
.PP
The meaning of secondary dates is up to you.
Eg it could be \[dq]primary is the bank\[aq]s clearing date, secondary
is the date the transaction was initiated, if different\[dq].
.PP
In practice, this feature usually adds confusion:
.IP \[bu] 2
You have to remember the primary and secondary dates\[aq] meaning, and
follow that consistently.
.IP \[bu] 2
It splits your bookkeeping into two modes, and you have to remember
which mode is appropriate for a given report.
.IP \[bu] 2
Usually your balance assertions will work with only one of these modes.
.IP \[bu] 2
It makes your financial data more complicated, less portable, and less
clear in an audit.
.IP \[bu] 2
It interacts with every feature, creating an ongoing cost for
implementors.
.IP \[bu] 2
It distracts new users and supporters.
.IP \[bu] 2
Posting dates are simpler and work better.
.PP
So secondary dates are officially deprecated in hledger, remaining only
as a Ledger compatibility aid; we recommend using posting dates instead.
.SS Star comments
Lines beginning with \f[CR]*\f[R] (star/asterisk) are also comment
lines.
This feature allows Emacs users to insert org headings in their journal,
allowing them to fold/unfold/navigate it like an outline when viewed
with org mode.
.PP
Downsides: another, unconventional comment syntax to learn.
Decreases your journal\[aq]s portability.
And switching to Emacs org mode just for folding/unfolding meant losing
the benefits of ledger mode; nowadays you can add outshine mode to
ledger mode to get folding without losing ledger mode\[aq]s features.
.SS Valuation expressions
Ledger allows a valuation function or value to be written in double
parentheses after an amount.
hledger ignores these.
.SS Virtual postings
A posting with parentheses around the account name, like
\f[CR](some:account)   10\f[R], is called an \f[I]unbalanced virtual
posting\f[R].
These postings do not participate in transaction balancing.
(And if you write them without an amount, a zero amount is always
inferred.)
These can occasionally be convenient for special circumstances, but they
violate double entry bookkeeping and make your data less portable across
applications, so many people avoid using them at all.
.PP
A posting with brackets around the account name
(\f[CR][some:account]\f[R]) is called a \f[I]balanced virtual
posting\f[R].
The balanced virtual postings in a transaction must add up to zero, just
like ordinary postings, but separately from them.
These are not part of double entry bookkeeping either, but they are at
least balanced.
An example:
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01 buy food with cash, update budget envelope subaccounts, & something else
  assets:cash                    $\-10  ; <\- these balance each other
  expenses:food                    $7  ; <\-
  expenses:food                    $3  ; <\-
  [assets:checking:budget:food]  $\-10  ;   <\- and these balance each other
  [assets:checking:available]     $10  ;   <\-
  (something:else)                 $5  ;     <\- this is not required to balance
.EE
.PP
Ordinary postings, whose account names are neither parenthesised nor
bracketed, are called \f[I]real postings\f[R].
You can exclude virtual postings from reports with the
\f[CR]\-R/\-\-real\f[R] flag or a \f[CR]real:1\f[R] query.
.SS Other Ledger directives
These other Ledger directives are currently accepted but ignored.
This allows hledger to read more Ledger files, but be aware that
hledger\[aq]s reports may differ from Ledger\[aq]s if you use these.

.SS Other cost/lot notations
A slight digression for Ledger and Beancount users.
Ledger has a number of cost/lot\-related notations:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[at] UNITCOST\f[R] and \f[CR]\[at]\[at] TOTALCOST\f[R]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
expresses a conversion rate, as in hledger
.IP \[bu] 2

.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR](\[at]) UNITCOST\f[R] and \f[CR](\[at]\[at]) TOTALCOST\f[R]

.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
like the above, but also means \[dq]this cost was exceptional, don\[aq]t
use it when inferring market prices\[dq].
.RE
.PP
Currently, hledger treats the above like \f[CR]\[at]\f[R] and
\f[CR]\[at]\[at]\f[R]; the parentheses are ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]{=FIXEDUNITCOST}\f[R] and \f[CR]{{=FIXEDTOTALCOST}}\f[R] (fixed

Currently, hledger accepts any or all of the above in any order after
the posting amount, but ignores them.

\f[CR]{UNITCOST, YYYY\-MM\-DD, \[dq]LABEL\[dq]}\f[R] etc.

Currently, hledger rejects these.
.PP
.SH CSV
hledger can read CSV files (Character Separated Value \- usually comma,
semicolon, or tab) containing dated records, automatically converting
each record into a transaction.
.PP
(To learn about \f[I]writing\f[R] CSV, see CSV output.)
.PP
For best error messages when reading CSV/TSV/SSV files, make sure they
have a corresponding \f[CR].csv\f[R], \f[CR].tsv\f[R] or \f[CR].ssv\f[R]
file extension or use a hledger file prefix (see File Extension below).
.PP
Each CSV file must be described by a corresponding \f[I]rules file\f[R].
.PD 0
.P
.PD
This contains rules describing the CSV data (header line, fields layout,
date format etc.), how to construct hledger transactions from it, and
how to categorise transactions based on description or other attributes.
.PP
By default, hledger expects this rules file to be named like the CSV
file, with an extra \f[CR].rules\f[R] extension added, in the same
directory.
Eg when asked to read \f[CR]foo/FILE.csv\f[R], hledger looks for
\f[CR]foo/FILE.csv.rules\f[R].
You can specify a different rules file with the \f[CR]\-\-rules\f[R]
option.
.PP
At minimum, the rules file must identify the date and amount fields, and
often it also specifies the date format and how many header lines there
are.
Here\[aq]s a simple CSV file and a rules file for it:
.IP
.EX
Date, Description, Id, Amount
12/11/2019, Foo, 123, 10.23
.EE

.PP
Working with CSV tips can be found below, including How CSV rules are
evaluated.
.SS \f[CR]source\f[R]
If you tell hledger to read a csv file with \f[CR]\-f foo.csv\f[R], it
will look for rules in \f[CR]foo.csv.rules\f[R].
Or, you can tell it to read the rules file, with
\f[CR]\-f foo.csv.rules\f[R], and it will look for data in
\f[CR]foo.csv\f[R] (since 1.30).
.PP
These are mostly equivalent, but the second method provides some extra
features.
For one, the data file can be missing, without causing an error; it is
just considered empty.
And, you can specify a different data file by adding a \[dq]source\[dq]
rule:
.IP
.EX
source ./Checking1.csv
.EE
.PP
If you specify just a file name with no path, hledger will look for it
in your system\[aq]s downloads directory (\f[CR]\[ti]/Downloads\f[R],
currently):
.IP
.EX
source Checking1.csv
.EE
.PP
And if you specify a glob pattern, hledger will read the most recent of
the matched files (useful with repeated downloads):
.IP
.EX
source Checking1*.csv
.EE
.PP
See also \[dq]Working with CSV > Reading files specified by rule\[dq].
.SS \f[CR]separator\f[R]
You can use the \f[CR]separator\f[R] rule to read other kinds of
character\-separated data.
The argument is any single separator character, or the words
\f[CR]tab\f[R] or \f[CR]space\f[R] (case insensitive).
Eg, for comma\-separated values (CSV):
.IP
.EX
separator ,
.EE
.PP
or for semicolon\-separated values (SSV):
.IP
.EX
separator ;
.EE
.PP
or for tab\-separated values (TSV):
.IP
.EX
separator TAB
.EE
.PP
If the input file has a \f[CR].csv\f[R], \f[CR].ssv\f[R] or
\f[CR].tsv\f[R] file extension (or a \f[CR]csv:\f[R], \f[CR]ssv:\f[R],
\f[CR]tsv:\f[R] prefix), the appropriate separator will be inferred
automatically, and you won\[aq]t need this rule.
.SS \f[CR]skip\f[R]
.IP
.EX
skip N
.EE
.PP
The word \f[CR]skip\f[R] followed by a number (or no number, meaning 1)
tells hledger to ignore this many non\-empty lines at the start of the
input data.
You\[aq]ll need this whenever your CSV data contains header lines.
Note, empty and blank lines are skipped automatically, so you don\[aq]t
need to count those.
.PP
\f[CR]skip\f[R] has a second meaning: it can be used inside if blocks
(described below), to skip one or more records whenever the condition is
true.
Records skipped in this way are ignored, except they are still required
to be valid CSV.
.SS \f[CR]date\-format\f[R]
.IP
.EX
date\-format DATEFMT
.EE
.PP
This is a helper for the \f[CR]date\f[R] (and \f[CR]date2\f[R]) fields.
If your CSV dates are not formatted like \f[CR]YYYY\-MM\-DD\f[R],
\f[CR]YYYY/MM/DD\f[R] or \f[CR]YYYY.MM.DD\f[R], you\[aq]ll need to add a
date\-format rule describing them with a strptime\-style date parsing
pattern \- see
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time/docs/Data\-Time\-Format.html#v:formatTime.
The pattern must parse the CSV date value completely.
Some examples:
.IP
.EX
# MM/DD/YY
date\-format %m/%d/%y
.EE
.IP
.EX
# D/M/YYYY
# The \- makes leading zeros optional.
date\-format %\-d/%\-m/%Y
.EE
.IP
.EX
# YYYY\-Mmm\-DD
date\-format %Y\-%h\-%d
.EE
.IP
.EX
# M/D/YYYY HH:MM AM some other junk
# Note the time and junk must be fully parsed, though only the date is used.
date\-format %\-m/%\-d/%Y %l:%M %p some other junk
.EE
.SS \f[CR]timezone\f[R]
.IP
.EX
timezone TIMEZONE
.EE
.PP
When CSV contains date\-times that are implicitly in some time zone
other than yours, but containing no explicit time zone information, you
can use this rule to declare the CSV\[aq]s native time zone, which helps
prevent off\-by\-one dates.
.PP
When the CSV date\-times do contain time zone information, you don\[aq]t
need this rule; instead, use \f[CR]%Z\f[R] in \f[CR]date\-format\f[R]
(or \f[CR]%z\f[R], \f[CR]%EZ\f[R], \f[CR]%Ez\f[R]; see the formatTime
link above).
.PP
In either of these cases, hledger will do a time\-zone\-aware
conversion, localising the CSV date\-times to your current system time
zone.
If you prefer to localise to some other time zone, eg for
reproducibility, you can (on unix at least) set the output timezone with
the TZ environment variable, eg:
.IP
.EX
$ TZ=\-1000 hledger print \-f foo.csv  # or TZ=\-1000 hledger import foo.csv
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]timezone\f[R] currently does not understand timezone names, except
\[dq]UTC\[dq], \[dq]GMT\[dq], \[dq]EST\[dq], \[dq]EDT\[dq],
\[dq]CST\[dq], \[dq]CDT\[dq], \[dq]MST\[dq], \[dq]MDT\[dq],
\[dq]PST\[dq], or \[dq]PDT\[dq].
For others, use numeric format: +HHMM or \-HHMM.
.SS \f[CR]newest\-first\f[R]
hledger tries to ensure that the generated transactions will be ordered
chronologically, including same\-day transactions.
Usually it can auto\-detect how the CSV records are ordered.
But if it encounters CSV where all records are on the same date, it
assumes that the records are oldest first.
If in fact the CSV\[aq]s records are normally newest first, like:
.IP
.EX
2022\-10\-01, txn 3...
2022\-10\-01, txn 2...
2022\-10\-01, txn 1...
.EE
.PP
you can add the \f[CR]newest\-first\f[R] rule to help hledger generate
the transactions in correct order.
.IP
.EX
# same\-day CSV records are newest first
newest\-first
.EE
.SS \f[CR]intra\-day\-reversed\f[R]
If CSV records within a single day are ordered opposite to the overall
record order, you can add the \f[CR]intra\-day\-reversed\f[R] rule to
improve the order of journal entries.
Eg, here the overall record order is newest first, but same\-day records
are oldest first:
.IP
.EX
2022\-10\-02, txn 3...
2022\-10\-02, txn 4...
2022\-10\-01, txn 1...
2022\-10\-01, txn 2...
.EE
.IP
.EX
# transactions within each day are reversed with respect to the overall date order
intra\-day\-reversed
.EE
.SS \f[CR]decimal\-mark\f[R]
.IP
.EX
decimal\-mark .
.EE
.PP
or:
.IP
.EX
decimal\-mark ,
.EE
.PP
hledger automatically accepts either period or comma as a decimal mark
when parsing numbers (cf Amounts).
However if any numbers in the CSV contain digit group marks, such as
thousand\-separating commas, you should declare the decimal mark
explicitly with this rule, to avoid misparsed numbers.
.SS \f[CR]fields\f[R] list
.IP
.EX
fields FIELDNAME1, FIELDNAME2, ...
.EE
.PP
A fields list (the word \f[CR]fields\f[R] followed by comma\-separated
field names) is optional, but convenient.
It does two things:
.IP "1." 3
It names the CSV field in each column.
This can be convenient if you are referencing them in other rules, so
you can say \f[CR]%SomeField\f[R] instead of remembering \f[CR]%13\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Whenever you use one of the special hledger field names (described
below), it assigns the CSV value in this position to that hledger field.
This is the quickest way to populate hledger\[aq]s fields and build a
transaction.
.PP
Here\[aq]s an example that says \[dq]use the 1st, 2nd and 4th fields as
the transaction\[aq]s date, description and amount; name the last two
fields for later reference; and ignore the others\[dq]:
.IP
.EX
fields date, description, , amount, , , somefield, anotherfield
.EE
.PP
In a fields list, the separator is always comma; it is unrelated to the
CSV file\[aq]s separator.
Also:
.IP \[bu] 2
There must be least two items in the list (at least one comma).
.IP \[bu] 2
Field names may not contain spaces.
Spaces before/after field names are optional.
.IP \[bu] 2
Field names may contain \f[CR]_\f[R] (underscore) or \f[CR]\-\f[R]
(hyphen).
.IP \[bu] 2
Fields you don\[aq]t care about can be given a dummy name or an empty
name.
.PP
If the CSV contains column headings, it\[aq]s convenient to use these
for your field names, suitably modified (eg lower\-cased with spaces
replaced by underscores).
.PP
Sometimes you may want to alter a CSV field name to avoid assigning to a
hledger field with the same name.
Eg you could call the CSV\[aq]s \[dq]balance\[dq] field
\f[CR]balance_\f[R] to avoid directly setting hledger\[aq]s
\f[CR]balance\f[R] field (and generating a balance assertion).
.SS Field assignment
.IP
.EX
HLEDGERFIELD FIELDVALUE
.EE
.PP
Field assignments are the more flexible way to assign CSV values to
hledger fields.
They can be used instead of or in addition to a fields list (see above).
.PP
To assign a value to a hledger field, write the field name (any of the
standard hledger field/pseudo\-field names, defined below), a space,
followed by a text value on the same line.
This text value may interpolate CSV fields, referenced either by their
1\-based position in the CSV record (\f[CR]%N\f[R]) or by the name they
were given in the fields list (\f[CR]%CSVFIELD\f[R]), and regular
expression match groups (\f[CR]\[rs]N\f[R]).
.PP
Some examples:
.IP
.EX
# set the amount to the 4th CSV field, with \[dq] USD\[dq] appended
amount %4 USD

# combine three fields to make a comment, containing note: and date: tags
comment note: %somefield \- %anotherfield, date: %1
.EE
.PP
Tips:
.IP \[bu] 2
Interpolation strips outer whitespace (so a CSV value like
\f[CR]\[dq] 1 \[dq]\f[R] becomes \f[CR]1\f[R] when interpolated)
(#1051).
.IP \[bu] 2
Interpolations always refer to a CSV field \- you can\[aq]t interpolate
a hledger field.
(See Referencing other fields below).
.SS Field names
Note the two kinds of field names mentioned here, and used only in
hledger CSV rules files:
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CSV field names\f[R] (\f[CR]CSVFIELD\f[R] in these docs): you can
optionally name the CSV columns for easy reference (since hledger
doesn\[aq]t yet automatically recognise column headings in a CSV file),
by writing arbitrary names in a \f[CR]fields\f[R] list, eg:
.RS 4
.IP
.EX
fields When, What, Some_Id, Net, Total, Foo, Bar
.EE
.RE
.IP "2." 3
Special \f[B]hledger field names\f[R] (\f[CR]HLEDGERFIELD\f[R] in these
docs): you must set at least some of these to generate the hledger
transaction from a CSV record, by writing them as the left hand side of
a field assignment, eg:
.RS 4
.IP
.EX
date        %When
code        %Some_Id
description %What
comment     %Foo %Bar
amount1     $ %Total
.EE
.PP
or directly in a \f[CR]fields\f[R] list:
.IP
.EX
fields date, description, code, , amount1, Foo, Bar
currency $
comment  %Foo %Bar
.EE
.RE
.PP
Here are all the special hledger field names available, and what happens
when you assign values to them:
.SS date field
Assigning to \f[CR]date\f[R] sets the transaction date.
.SS date2 field
\f[CR]date2\f[R] sets the transaction\[aq]s secondary date, if any.
.SS status field
\f[CR]status\f[R] sets the transaction\[aq]s status, if any.
.SS code field
\f[CR]code\f[R] sets the transaction\[aq]s code, if any.
.SS description field
\f[CR]description\f[R] sets the transaction\[aq]s description, if any.
.SS comment field
\f[CR]comment\f[R] sets the transaction\[aq]s comment, if any.
.PP
\f[CR]commentN\f[R], where N is a number, sets the Nth posting\[aq]s
comment.
.PP
You can assign multi\-line comments by writing literal \f[CR]\[rs]n\f[R]
in the code.
A comment starting with \f[CR]\[rs]n\f[R] will begin on a new line.
.PP
Comments can contain tags, as usual.
.PP
Posting comments can also contain a posting date.
A secondary date, or a year\-less date, will be ignored.
.SS account field
Assigning to \f[CR]accountN\f[R], where N is 1 to 99, sets the account
name of the Nth posting, and causes that posting to be generated.
.PP
Most often there are two postings, so you\[aq]ll want to set
\f[CR]account1\f[R] and \f[CR]account2\f[R].
Typically \f[CR]account1\f[R] is associated with the CSV file, and is
set once with a top\-level assignment, while \f[CR]account2\f[R] is set
based on each transaction\[aq]s description, in conditional rules.
.PP
If a posting\[aq]s account name is left unset but its amount is set (see
below), a default account name will be chosen (like
\[dq]expenses:unknown\[dq] or \[dq]income:unknown\[dq]).
.SS amount field
There are several ways to set posting amounts from CSV, useful in
different situations.
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]\f[CB]amount\f[B]\f[R] is the oldest and simplest.
Assigning to this sets the amount of the first and second postings.
In the second posting, the amount will be negated; also, if it has a
cost attached, it will be converted to cost.
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]\f[CB]amount\-in\f[B]\f[R] and \f[B]\f[CB]amount\-out\f[B]\f[R]
work exactly like the above, but should be used when the CSV has two
amount fields (such as \[dq]Debit\[dq] and \[dq]Credit\[dq], or
\[dq]Inflow\[dq] and \[dq]Outflow\[dq]).
Whichever field has a non\-zero value will be used as the amount of the
first and second postings.
Here are some tips to avoid confusion:
.RS 4
.IP \[bu] 2
It\[aq]s not \[dq]amount\-in for posting 1 and amount\-out for posting
2\[dq], it is \[dq]extract a single amount from the amount\-in or
amount\-out field, and use that for posting 1 and (negated) for posting
2\[dq].
.IP \[bu] 2
Don\[aq]t use both \f[CR]amount\f[R] and
\f[CR]amount\-in\f[R]/\f[CR]amount\-out\f[R] in the same rules file;
choose based on whether the amount is in a single CSV field or spread
across two fields.
.IP \[bu] 2
In each record, at most one of the two CSV fields should contain a
non\-zero amount; the other field must contain a zero or nothing.
.IP \[bu] 2
hledger assumes both CSV fields contain unsigned numbers, and it
automatically negates the amount\-out values.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the data doesn\[aq]t fit these requirements, you\[aq]ll probably need
an if rule (see below).
.RE
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]\f[CB]amountN\f[B]\f[R] (where N is a number from 1 to 99) sets the
amount of only a single posting: the Nth posting in the transaction.
You\[aq]ll usually need at least two such assignments to make a balanced
transaction.
You can also generate more than two postings, to represent more complex
transactions.
The posting numbers don\[aq]t have to be consecutive; with if rules,
higher posting numbers can be useful to ensure a certain order of
postings.
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]\f[CB]amountN\-in\f[B]\f[R] and \f[B]\f[CB]amountN\-out\f[B]\f[R]
work exactly like the above, but should be used when the CSV has two
amount fields.
This is analogous to \f[CR]amount\-in\f[R] and \f[CR]amount\-out\f[R],
and those tips also apply here.
.IP "5." 3
Remember that a \f[CR]fields\f[R] list can also do assignments.
So in a fields list if you name a CSV field \[dq]amount\[dq], that
counts as assigning to \f[CR]amount\f[R].
(If you don\[aq]t want that, call it something else in the fields list,
like \[dq]amount_\[dq].)
.IP "6." 3
The above don\[aq]t handle every situation; if you need more
flexibility, use an \f[CR]if\f[R] rule to set amounts conditionally.
See \[dq]Working with CSV > Setting amounts\[dq] below for more on this
and on amount\-setting generally.
.SS currency field
\f[CR]currency\f[R] sets a currency symbol, to be prepended to all
postings\[aq] amounts.
You can use this if the CSV amounts do not have a currency symbol, eg if
it is in a separate column.
.PP
\f[CR]currencyN\f[R] prepends a currency symbol to just the Nth
posting\[aq]s amount.
.SS balance field
\f[CR]balanceN\f[R] sets a balance assertion amount (or if the posting
amount is left empty, a balance assignment) on posting N.
.PP
\f[CR]balance\f[R] is a compatibility spelling for hledger <1.17; it is
equivalent to \f[CR]balance1\f[R].
.PP
You can adjust the type of assertion/assignment with the
\f[CR]balance\-type\f[R] rule (see below).
.PP
See the Working with CSV tips below for more about setting amounts and
currency.
.SS \f[CR]if\f[R] block
Rules can be applied conditionally, depending on patterns in the CSV
data.
This allows flexibility; in particular, it is how you can categorise
transactions, selecting an appropriate account name based on their
description (for example).
There are two ways to write conditional rules: \[dq]if blocks\[dq],
described here, and \[dq]if tables\[dq], described below.
.PP
An if block is the word \f[CR]if\f[R] and one or more \[dq]matcher\[dq]
expressions (can be a word or phrase), one per line, starting either on
the same or next line; followed by one or more indented rules.
Eg,
.IP
.EX
if MATCHER
 RULE
.EE
.PP
or
.IP
.EX
if
MATCHER
MATCHER
MATCHER
 RULE
 RULE
.EE
.PP
If any of the matchers succeeds, all of the indented rules will be
applied.
They are usually field assignments, but the following special rules may
also be used within an if block:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]skip\f[R] \- skips the matched CSV record (generating no
transaction from it)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]end\f[R] \- skips the rest of the current CSV file.
.PP
Some examples:
.IP
.EX
# if the record contains \[dq]groceries\[dq], set account2 to \[dq]expenses:groceries\[dq]
if groceries
 account2 expenses:groceries
.EE
.IP
.EX
# if the record contains any of these phrases, set account2 and a transaction comment as shown
if
monthly service fee
atm transaction fee
banking thru software
 account2 expenses:business:banking
 comment  XXX deductible ? check it
.EE
.IP
.EX
# if an empty record is seen (assuming five fields), ignore the rest of the CSV file
if ,,,,
 end
.EE
.SS Matchers
There are two kinds:
.IP "1." 3
A record matcher is a word or single\-line text fragment or regular
expression (\f[CR]REGEX\f[R]), which hledger will try to match
case\-insensitively anywhere within the CSV record.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Eg: \f[CR]whole foods\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
A field matcher is preceded with a percent sign and CSV field name
(\f[CR]%CSVFIELD REGEX\f[R]).
hledger will try to match these just within the named CSV field.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Eg: \f[CR]%date 2023\f[R]
.PP
The regular expression is (as usual in hledger) a POSIX extended regular
expression, that also supports GNU word boundaries (\f[CR]\[rs]b\f[R],
\f[CR]\[rs]B\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]<\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]>\f[R]), and nothing
else.
If you have trouble, see \[dq]Regular expressions\[dq] in the hledger
manual (https://hledger.org/hledger.html#regular\-expressions).
.SS What matchers match
With record matchers, it\[aq]s important to know that the record matched
is not the original CSV record, but a modified one: separators will be
converted to commas, and enclosing double quotes (but not enclosing
whitespace) are removed.
So for example, when reading an SSV file, if the original record was:
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01; \[dq]Acme, Inc.\[dq];  1,000
.EE
.PP
the regex would see, and try to match, this modified record text:
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01,Acme, Inc.,  1,000
.EE
.SS Combining matchers
When an if block has multiple matchers, they are combined as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
By default they are OR\[aq]d (any of them can match)
.IP \[bu] 2
When a matcher is preceded by ampersand (\f[CR]&\f[R], at the start of
the line) it will be AND\[aq]ed with the previous matcher (all in the
AND\[aq]ed group must match)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R] When a matcher is preceded by an exclamation
mark (\f[CR]!\f[R]), it is negated (it must not match).
.PP
Note currently there is a limitation: you can\[aq]t use both
\f[CR]&\f[R] and \f[CR]!\f[R] on the same line (you can\[aq]t AND a
negated matcher).
.SS Match groups
\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]
.PP
Matchers can define match groups: parenthesised portions of the regular
expression which are available for reference in field assignments.
Groups are enclosed in regular parentheses (\f[CR](\f[R] and
\f[CR])\f[R]) and can be nested.
Each group is available in field assignments using the token
\f[CR]\[rs]N\f[R], where N is an index into the match groups for this
conditional block (e.g.
\f[CR]\[rs]1\f[R], \f[CR]\[rs]2\f[R], etc.).
.PP
Example: Warp credit card payment postings to the beginning of the
billing period (Month start), to match how they are presented in
statements, using posting dates:
.IP
.EX
if %date (....\-..)\-..
  comment2 date:\[rs]1\-01
.EE
.PP
Another example: Read the expense account from the CSV field, but throw
away a prefix:
.IP
.EX
if %account1 liabilities:family:(expenses:.*)
    account1 \[rs]1
.EE
.SS \f[CR]if\f[R] table
\[dq]if tables\[dq] are an alternative to if blocks; they can express
many matchers and field assignments in a more compact tabular format,
like this:
.IP
.EX
if,HLEDGERFIELD1,HLEDGERFIELD2,...
MATCHERA,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
MATCHERB,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
; Comment line that explains MATCHERC
MATCHERC,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
<empty line>
.EE
.PP
The first character after \f[CR]if\f[R] is taken to be this if
table\[aq]s field separator.
It is unrelated to the separator used in the CSV file.
It should be a non\-alphanumeric character like \f[CR],\f[R] or
\f[CR]|\f[R] that does not appear anywhere else in the table (it should
not be used in field names or matchers or values, and it cannot be
escaped with a backslash).
.PP
Each line must contain the same number of separators; empty values are
allowed.
Whitespace can be used in the matcher lines for readability (but not in
the if line, currently).
You can use the comment lines in the table body.
The table must be terminated by an empty line (or end of file).
.PP
An if table like the above is interpreted as follows: try all of the
matchers; whenever a matcher succeeds, assign all of the values on that
line to the corresponding hledger fields; If multiple lines match, later
lines will override fields assigned by the earlier ones \- just like the
sequence of \f[CR]if\f[R] blocks would behave.
.PP
If table presented above is equivalent to this sequence of if blocks:
.IP
.EX
if MATCHERA
  HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
  HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
  ...

if MATCHERB
  HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
  HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
  ...

; Comment line which explains MATCHERC
if MATCHERC
  HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
  HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
  ...
.EE
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
if,account2,comment
atm transaction fee,expenses:business:banking,deductible? check it
%description groceries,expenses:groceries,
;; Comment line that desribes why this particular date is special
2023/01/12.*Plumbing LLC,expenses:house:upkeep,emergency plumbing call\-out
.EE
.SS \f[CR]balance\-type\f[R]
Balance assertions generated by assigning to balanceN are of the simple
\f[CR]=\f[R] type by default, which is a single\-commodity,
subaccount\-excluding assertion.
You may find the subaccount\-including variants more useful, eg if you
have created some virtual subaccounts of checking to help with
budgeting.
You can select a different type of assertion with the
\f[CR]balance\-type\f[R] rule:
.IP
.EX
# balance assertions will consider all commodities and all subaccounts
balance\-type ==*
.EE
.PP
Here are the balance assertion types for quick reference:
.IP
.EX
=    single commodity, exclude subaccounts
=*   single commodity, include subaccounts
==   multi commodity,  exclude subaccounts
==*  multi commodity,  include subaccounts
.EE
.SS \f[CR]include\f[R]
.IP
.EX
include RULESFILE
.EE
.PP
This includes the contents of another CSV rules file at this point.
\f[CR]RULESFILE\f[R] is an absolute file path or a path relative to the
current file\[aq]s directory.
This can be useful for sharing common rules between several rules files,
eg:
.IP
.EX
# someaccount.csv.rules

## someaccount\-specific rules
fields   date,description,amount
account1 assets:someaccount
account2 expenses:misc

## common rules
include categorisation.rules
.EE
.SS Working with CSV
Some tips:
.SS Rapid feedback
It\[aq]s a good idea to get rapid feedback while
creating/troubleshooting CSV rules.
Here\[aq]s a good way, using entr from eradman.com/entrproject:
.IP
.EX
$ ls foo.csv* | entr bash \-c \[aq]echo \-\-\-\-; hledger \-f foo.csv print desc:SOMEDESC\[aq]
.EE
.PP
A desc: query (eg) is used to select just one, or a few, transactions of
interest.
\[dq]bash \-c\[dq] is used to run multiple commands, so we can echo a
separator each time the command re\-runs, making it easier to read the
output.
.SS Valid CSV
Note that hledger will only accept valid CSV conforming to RFC 4180, and
equivalent SSV and TSV formats (like RFC 4180 but with semicolon or tab
as separators).
This means, eg:
.IP \[bu] 2
Values may be enclosed in double quotes, or not.
Enclosing in single quotes is not allowed.
(Eg \f[CR]\[aq]A\[aq],\[aq]B\[aq]\f[R] is rejected.)
.IP \[bu] 2
When values are enclosed in double quotes, spaces outside the quotes are
not allowed.
(Eg \f[CR]\[dq]A\[dq], \[dq]B\[dq]\f[R] is rejected.)
.IP \[bu] 2
When values are not enclosed in quotes, they may not contain double
quotes.
(Eg \f[CR]A\[dq]A, B\f[R] is rejected.)
.PP
If your CSV/SSV/TSV is not valid in this sense, you\[aq]ll need to
transform it before reading with hledger.
Try using sed, or a more permissive CSV parser like python\[aq]s csv
lib.
.SS File Extension
To help hledger choose the CSV file reader and show the right error
messages (and choose the right field separator character by default),
it\[aq]s best if CSV/SSV/TSV files are named with a \f[CR].csv\f[R],
\f[CR].ssv\f[R] or \f[CR].tsv\f[R] filename extension.
(More about this at Data formats.)
.PP
When reading files with the \[dq]wrong\[dq] extension, you can ensure
the CSV reader (and the default field separator) by prefixing the file
path with \f[CR]csv:\f[R], \f[CR]ssv:\f[R] or \f[CR]tsv:\f[R]: Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f ssv:foo.dat print
.EE
.PP
You can also override the default field separator with a separator rule
if needed.
.SS Reading CSV from standard input
You\[aq]ll need the file format prefix when reading CSV from stdin also,
since hledger assumes journal format by default.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ cat foo.dat | hledger \-f ssv:\- print
.EE
.SS Reading multiple CSV files
If you use multiple \f[CR]\-f\f[R] options to read multiple CSV files at
once, hledger will look for a correspondingly\-named rules file for each
CSV file.
But if you specify a rules file with \f[CR]\-\-rules\f[R], that rules
file will be used for all the CSV files.
.SS Reading files specified by rule
Instead of specifying a CSV file in the command line, you can specify a
rules file, as in \f[CR]hledger \-f foo.csv.rules CMD\f[R].
By default this will read data from foo.csv in the same directory, but
you can add a source rule to specify a different data file, perhaps
located in your web browser\[aq]s download directory.
.PP
This feature was added in hledger 1.30, so you won\[aq]t see it in most
CSV rules examples.
But it helps remove some of the busywork of managing CSV downloads.
Most of your financial institutions\[aq]s default CSV filenames are
different and can be recognised by a glob pattern.
So you can put a rule like \f[CR]source Checking1*.csv\f[R] in
foo\-checking.csv.rules, and then periodically follow a workflow like:
.IP "1." 3
Download CSV from Foo\[aq]s website, using your browser\[aq]s defaults
.IP "2." 3
Run \f[CR]hledger import foo\-checking.csv.rules\f[R] to import any new
transactions
.PP
After import, you can: discard the CSV, or leave it where it is for a
while, or move it into your archives, as you prefer.
If you do nothing, next time your browser will save something like
Checking1\-2.csv, and hledger will use that because of the \f[CR]*\f[R]
wild card and because it is the most recent.
.SS Valid transactions
After reading a CSV file, hledger post\-processes and validates the
generated journal entries as it would for a journal file \- balancing
them, applying balance assignments, and canonicalising amount styles.
Any errors at this stage will be reported in the usual way, displaying
the problem entry.
.PP
There is one exception: balance assertions, if you have generated them,
will not be checked, since normally these will work only when the CSV
data is part of the main journal.
If you do need to check balance assertions generated from CSV right
away, pipe into another hledger:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f file.csv print | hledger \-f\- print
.EE
.SS Deduplicating, importing
When you download a CSV file periodically, eg to get your latest bank
transactions, the new file may overlap with the old one, containing some
of the same records.
.PP
The import command will (a) detect the new transactions, and (b) append
just those transactions to your main journal.
It is idempotent, so you don\[aq]t have to remember how many times you
ran it or with which version of the CSV.
(It keeps state in a hidden \f[CR].latest.FILE.csv\f[R] file.)
This is the easiest way to import CSV data.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
# download the latest CSV files, then run this command.
# Note, no \-f flags needed here.
$ hledger import *.csv [\-\-dry]
.EE
.PP
This method works for most CSV files.
(Where records have a stable chronological order, and new records appear
only at the new end.)
.PP
A number of other tools and workflows, hledger\-specific and otherwise,
exist for converting, deduplicating, classifying and managing CSV data.
See:

.SS Setting amounts
Continuing from amount field above, here are more tips for
amount\-setting:
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]If the amount is in a single CSV field:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.RS 4
.IP "a." 3
\f[B]If its sign indicates direction of flow:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Assign it to \f[CR]amountN\f[R], to set the Nth posting\[aq]s amount.
N is usually 1 or 2 but can go up to 99.
.IP "b." 3
\f[B]If another field indicates direction of flow:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Use one or more conditional rules to set the appropriate amount sign.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
# assume a withdrawal unless Type contains \[dq]deposit\[dq]:
amount1  \-%Amount
if %Type deposit
  amount1  %Amount
.EE
.RE
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]If the amount is in two CSV fields (such as Debit and Credit, or In
and Out):\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.RS 4
.IP "a." 3
\f[B]If both fields are unsigned:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Assign one field to \f[CR]amountN\-in\f[R] and the other to
\f[CR]amountN\-out\f[R].
hledger will automatically negate the \[dq]out\[dq] field, and will use
whichever field value is non\-zero as posting N\[aq]s amount.
.IP "b." 3
\f[B]If either field is signed:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
You will probably need to override hledger\[aq]s sign for one or the
other field, as in the following example:
.IP
.EX
# Negate the \-out value, but only if it is not empty:
fields date, description, amount1\-in, amount1\-out
if %amount1\-out [1\-9]
 amount1\-out \-%amount1\-out
.EE
.IP "c." 3
\f[B]If both fields can contain a non\-zero value (or both can be
empty):\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The \-in/\-out rules normally choose the value which is
non\-zero/non\-empty.
Some value pairs can be ambiguous, such as \f[CR]1\f[R] and
\f[CR]none\f[R].
For such cases, use conditional rules to help select the amount.
Eg, to handle the above you could select the value containing non\-zero
digits:
.IP
.EX
fields date, description, in, out
if %in [1\-9]
 amount1 %in
if %out [1\-9]
 amount1 %out
.EE
.RE
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]If you want posting 2\[aq]s amount converted to cost:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Use the unnumbered \f[CR]amount\f[R] (or \f[CR]amount\-in\f[R] and
\f[CR]amount\-out\f[R]) syntax.
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]If the CSV has only balance amounts, not transaction amounts:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Assign to \f[CR]balanceN\f[R], to set a balance assignment on the Nth
posting, causing the posting\[aq]s amount to be calculated
automatically.
\f[CR]balance\f[R] with no number is equivalent to \f[CR]balance1\f[R].
In this situation hledger is more likely to guess the wrong default
account name, so you may need to set that explicitly.
.SS Amount signs
There is some special handling making it easier to parse and to reverse
amount signs.
(This only works for whole amounts, not for cost amounts such as COST in
\f[CR]amount1  AMT \[at] COST\f[R]):
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]If an amount value begins with a plus sign:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
that will be removed: \f[CR]+AMT\f[R] becomes \f[CR]AMT\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]If an amount value is parenthesised:\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
it will be de\-parenthesised and sign\-flipped: \f[CR](AMT)\f[R] becomes
\f[CR]\-AMT\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]If an amount value has two minus signs (or two sets of parentheses,
or a minus sign and parentheses):\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
they cancel out and will be removed: \f[CR]\-\-AMT\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-(AMT)\f[R] becomes \f[CR]AMT\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]If an amount value contains just a sign (or just a set of
parentheses):\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
that is removed, making it an empty value.
\f[CR]\[dq]+\[dq]\f[R] or \f[CR]\[dq]\-\[dq]\f[R] or
\f[CR]\[dq]()\[dq]\f[R] becomes \f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
It\[aq]s not possible (without preprocessing the CSV) to set an amount
to its absolute value, ie discard its sign.
.SS Setting currency/commodity
If the currency/commodity symbol is included in the CSV\[aq]s amount
field(s):
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01,foo,$123.00
.EE
.PP
you don\[aq]t have to do anything special for the commodity symbol, it
will be assigned as part of the amount.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
fields date,description,amount
.EE
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01 foo
    expenses:unknown         $123.00
    income:unknown          $\-123.00
.EE
.PP
If the currency is provided as a separate CSV field:
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01,foo,USD,123.00
.EE
.PP
You can assign that to the \f[CR]currency\f[R] pseudo\-field, which has
the special effect of prepending itself to every amount in the
transaction (on the left, with no separating space):
.IP
.EX
fields date,description,currency,amount
.EE
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01 foo
    expenses:unknown       USD123.00
    income:unknown        USD\-123.00
.EE
.PP
Or, you can use a field assignment to construct the amount yourself,
with more control.
Eg to put the symbol on the right, and separated by a space:
.IP
.EX
fields date,description,cur,amt
amount %amt %cur
.EE
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01 foo
    expenses:unknown        123.00 USD
    income:unknown         \-123.00 USD
.EE
.PP
Note we used a temporary field name (\f[CR]cur\f[R]) that is not
\f[CR]currency\f[R] \- that would trigger the prepending effect, which
we don\[aq]t want here.
.SS Amount decimal places
When you are reading CSV data, eg with a command like
\f[CR]hledger \-f foo.csv print\f[R], hledger will infer each
commodity\[aq]s decimal precision (and other commodity display styles)
from the amounts \- much as when reading a journal file without
\f[CR]commodity\f[R] directives (see the link).
.PP
Note, the commodity styles are not inferred from the numbers in the
original CSV data; rather, they are inferred from the amounts generated
by the CSV rules.
.PP
When you are importing CSV data with the \f[CR]import\f[R] command, eg
\f[CR]hledger import foo.csv\f[R], there\[aq]s another step:
\f[CR]import\f[R] tries to make the new entries conform to the
journal\[aq]s existing styles.
So for each commodity \- let\[aq]s say it\[aq]s EUR \- \f[CR]import\f[R]
will choose:
.IP "1." 3
the style declared for EUR by a \f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive in the
journal
.IP "2." 3
otherwise, the style inferred from EUR amounts in the journal
.IP "3." 3
otherwise, the style inferred from EUR amounts generated by the CSV
rules.
.PP
TLDR: if \f[CR]import\f[R] is not generating the precisions or styles
you want, add a \f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive to specify them.
.SS Referencing other fields
In field assignments, you can interpolate only CSV fields, not hledger
fields.
In the example below, there\[aq]s both a CSV field and a hledger field
named amount1, but %amount1 always means the CSV field, not the hledger
field:
.IP
.EX
# Name the third CSV field \[dq]amount1\[dq]
fields date,description,amount1

# Set hledger\[aq]s amount1 to the CSV amount1 field followed by USD
amount1 %amount1 USD

# Set comment to the CSV amount1 (not the amount1 assigned above)
comment %amount1
.EE
.PP
Here, since there\[aq]s no CSV amount1 field, %amount1 will produce a
literal \[dq]amount1\[dq]:
.IP
.EX
fields date,description,csvamount
amount1 %csvamount USD
# Can\[aq]t interpolate amount1 here
comment %amount1
.EE
.PP
When there are multiple field assignments to the same hledger field,
only the last one takes effect.
Here, comment\[aq]s value will be be B, or C if \[dq]something\[dq] is
matched, but never A:
.IP
.EX
comment A
comment B
if something
 comment C
.EE
.SS How CSV rules are evaluated
Here\[aq]s how to think of CSV rules being evaluated (if you really need
to).
First,
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]include\f[R] \- all includes are inlined, from top to bottom,
depth first.
(At each include point the file is inlined and scanned for further
includes, recursively, before proceeding.)
.PP
Then \[dq]global\[dq] rules are evaluated, top to bottom.
If a rule is repeated, the last one wins:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]skip\f[R] (at top level)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]date\-format\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]newest\-first\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]fields\f[R] \- names the CSV fields, optionally sets up initial
assignments to hledger fields
.PP
Then for each CSV record in turn:
.IP \[bu] 2
test all \f[CR]if\f[R] blocks.
If any of them contain a \f[CR]end\f[R] rule, skip all remaining CSV
records.
Otherwise if any of them contain a \f[CR]skip\f[R] rule, skip that many
CSV records.
If there are multiple matched \f[CR]skip\f[R] rules, the first one wins.
.IP \[bu] 2
collect all field assignments at top level and in matched \f[CR]if\f[R]
blocks.
When there are multiple assignments for a field, keep only the last one.
.IP \[bu] 2
compute a value for each hledger field \- either the one that was
assigned to it (and interpolate the %CSVFIELD references), or a default
.IP \[bu] 2
generate a hledger transaction (journal entry) from these values.
.PP
This is all part of the CSV reader, one of several readers hledger can
use to parse input files.
When all files have been read successfully, the transactions are passed
as input to whichever hledger command the user specified.
.PP
.SS Well factored rules
Some things than can help reduce duplication and complexity in rules
files:
.IP \[bu] 2
Extracting common rules usable with multiple CSV files into a
\f[CR]common.rules\f[R], and adding \f[CR]include common.rules\f[R] to
each CSV\[aq]s rules file.
.IP \[bu] 2
Splitting if blocks into smaller if blocks, extracting the frequently
used parts.
.SS CSV rules examples
.SS Bank of Ireland
Here\[aq]s a CSV with two amount fields (Debit and Credit), and a
balance field, which we can use to add balance assertions, which is not
necessary but provides extra error checking:

The balance assertions don\[aq]t raise an error above, because we\[aq]re
reading directly from CSV, but they will be checked if these entries are
imported into a journal file.
.SS Coinbase

.SH Timeclock
The time logging format of timeclock.el, as read by hledger.
.PP
hledger can read time logs in timeclock format.
As with Ledger, these are (a subset of) timeclock.el\[aq]s format,
containing clock\-in and clock\-out entries as in the example below.
The date is a simple date.
The time format is HH:MM[:SS][+\-ZZZZ].
Seconds and timezone are optional.
The timezone, if present, must be four digits and is ignored (currently
the time is always interpreted as a local time).
Lines beginning with \f[CR]#\f[R] or \f[CR];\f[R] or \f[CR]*\f[R], and
blank lines, are ignored.
.IP
.EX
i 2015/03/30 09:00:00 some account  optional description after 2 spaces ; optional comment, tags:

i 2015/03/31 22:21:45 another:account
o 2015/04/01 02:00:34
.EE
.PP
hledger treats each clock\-in/clock\-out pair as a transaction posting
some number of hours to an account.
Or if the session spans more than one day, it is split into several
transactions, one for each day.
For the above time log, \f[CR]hledger print\f[R] generates these journal
entries:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f t.timeclock print
2015\-03\-30 * optional description after 2 spaces   ; optional comment, tags:
    (some account)           0.33h

2015\-03\-31 * 22:21\-23:59
    (another:account)           1.64h

2015\-04\-01 * 00:00\-02:00
    (another:account)           2.01h
.EE
.PP
Here is a sample.timeclock to download and some queries to try:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f sample.timeclock balance                               # current time balances
$ hledger \-f sample.timeclock register \-p 2009/3                    # sessions in march 2009
$ hledger \-f sample.timeclock register \-p weekly \-\-depth 1 \-\-empty  # time summary by week
.EE
.PP
To generate time logs, ie to clock in and clock out, you could:
.IP \[bu] 2
use these shell aliases at the command line:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
alias ti=\[aq]echo i \[ga]date \[dq]+%Y\-%m\-%d %H:%M:%S\[dq]\[ga] $* >>$TIMELOG\[aq]
alias to=\[aq]echo o \[ga]date \[dq]+%Y\-%m\-%d %H:%M:%S\[dq]\[ga] >>$TIMELOG\[aq]
.EE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
or Emacs\[aq]s built\-in timeclock.el, or the extended timeclock\-x.el,
and perhaps the extras in ledgerutils.el
.IP \[bu] 2
or use the old \f[CR]ti\f[R] and \f[CR]to\f[R] scripts in the ledger 2.x
repository.
These rely on a \[dq]timeclock\[dq] executable which I think is just the
ledger 2 executable renamed.
.PP
.SH Timedot
\f[CR]timedot\f[R] format is hledger\[aq]s human\-friendly time logging
format.
Compared to \f[CR]timeclock\f[R] format, it is more convenient for
quick, approximate, and retroactive time logging, and more
human\-readable (you can see at a glance where time was spent).
A quick example:
.IP
.EX
2023\-05\-01
hom:errands          .... ....  ; two hours; the space is ignored
fos:hledger:timedot  ..         ; half an hour
per:admin:finance               ; no time spent yet
.EE
.PP
hledger reads this as a transaction on this day with three (unbalanced)
postings, where each dot represents \[dq]0.25\[dq].
No commodity symbol is assumed, but we typically interpret it as hours.
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f a.timedot print   # .timedot file extension (or timedot: prefix) is required
2023\-05\-01 *
    (hom:errands)                    2.00  ; two hours
    (fos:hledger:timedot)            0.50  ; half an hour
    (per:admin:finance)                 0
.EE
.PP
A timedot file contains a series of transactions (usually one per day).
Each begins with a \f[B]simple date\f[R] (Y\-M\-D, Y/M/D, or Y.M.D),
optionally be followed on the same line by a transaction description,
and/or a transaction comment following a semicolon.
.PP
After the date line are zero or more time postings, consisting of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]An account name\f[R] \- any hledger\-style account name, optionally
indented.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Two or more spaces\f[R] \- required if there is an amount (as in
journal format).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]A timedot amount\f[R], which can be
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
empty (representing zero)
.IP \[bu] 2
a number, optionally followed by a unit \f[CR]s\f[R], \f[CR]m\f[R],
\f[CR]h\f[R], \f[CR]d\f[R], \f[CR]w\f[R], \f[CR]mo\f[R], or
\f[CR]y\f[R], representing a precise number of seconds, minutes, hours,
days weeks, months or years (hours is assumed by default), which will be
converted to hours according to 60s = 1m, 60m = 1h, 24h = 1d, 7d = 1w,
30d = 1mo, 365d = 1y.
.IP \[bu] 2
one or more dots (period characters), each representing 0.25.
These are the dots in \[dq]timedot\[dq].
Spaces are ignored and can be used for grouping/alignment.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R] one or more letters.
These are like dots but they also generate a tag \f[CR]t:\f[R] (short
for \[dq]type\[dq]) with the letter as its value, and a separate posting
for each of the values.
This provides a second dimension of categorisation, viewable in reports
with \f[CR]\-\-pivot t\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]An optional comment\f[R] following a semicolon (a hledger\-style
posting comment).
.PP
There is some flexibility to help with keeping time log data and notes
in the same file:
.IP \[bu] 2
Blank lines and lines beginning with \f[CR]#\f[R] or \f[CR];\f[R] are
ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
After the first date line, lines which do not contain a double space are
parsed as postings with zero amount.
(hledger\[aq]s register reports will show these if you add \-E).
.IP \[bu] 2
Before the first date line, lines beginning with \f[CR]*\f[R] (eg org
headings) are ignored.
And from the first date line onward, Emacs org mode heading prefixes at
the start of lines (one or more \f[CR]*\f[R]\[aq]s followed by a space)
will be ignored.
This means the time log can also be a org outline.
.PP
Timedot files don\[aq]t support directives like journal files.
So a common pattern is to have a main journal file (eg
\f[CR]time.journal\f[R]) that contains any needed directives, and then
includes the timedot file (\f[CR]include time.timedot\f[R]).

.SH PART 3: REPORTING CONCEPTS
.SH Time periods
.SS Report start & end date
Most hledger reports will by default show the full time period
represented by the journal.
The report start date will be the earliest transaction or posting date,
and the report end date will be the latest transaction, posting, or
market price date.
.PP
Often you will want to see a shorter period, such as the current month.
You can specify a start and/or end date with the
\f[CR]\-b/\-\-begin\f[R], \f[CR]\-e/\-\-end\f[R], or
\f[CR]\-p/\-\-period\f[R] options, or a \f[CR]date:\f[R] query argument,
described below.
All of these accept the smart date syntax, also described below.
.PP
End dates are exclusive; specify the day after the last day you want to
see in the report.
.PP
When dates are specified by multiple options, the last (right\-most)
option wins.
And when \f[CR]date:\f[R] queries and date options are combined, the
report period will be their intersection.
.PP
Examples:
.TP
\f[CR]\-b 2016/3/17\f[R]
beginning on St.
Patrick\[cq]s day 2016
.TP
\f[CR]\-e 12/1\f[R]
ending at the start of December 1st in the current year
.TP
\f[CR]\-p \[aq]this month\[aq]\f[R]
during the current month
.TP
\f[CR]\-p thismonth\f[R]
same as above, spaces are optional
.TP
\f[CR]\-b 2023\f[R]
beginning on the first day of 2023
.TP
\f[CR]date:2023..\f[R] or \f[CR]date:2023\-\f[R]
same as above
.PP
\f[CR]\-b 2024 \-e 2025 \-p \[aq]2000 to 2030\[aq] date:2020\-01 date:2020\f[R]
:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
during January 2020 (the smallest common period, with the \-p overriding
\-b and \-e)
.SS Smart dates
In hledger\[aq]s user interfaces (though not in the journal file), you
can optionally use \[dq]smart date\[dq] syntax.
Smart dates can be written with english words, can be relative, and can
have parts omitted.
Missing parts are inferred as 1, when needed.
Smart dates can be interpreted as dates or periods depending on context.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
\f[CR]2004\-01\-01\f[R], \f[CR]2004/10/1\f[R], \f[CR]2004.9.1\f[R],
\f[CR]20240504\f[R] :
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Exact dates.
The year must have at least four digits, the month must be 1\-12, the
day must be 1\-31, the separator can be \f[CR]\-\f[R] or \f[CR]/\f[R] or
\f[CR].\f[R] or nothing.
.TP
\f[CR]2004\-10\f[R]
start of month
.TP
\f[CR]2004\f[R]
start of year
.TP
\f[CR]10/1\f[R] or \f[CR]oct\f[R] or \f[CR]october\f[R]
October 1st in current year
.TP
\f[CR]21\f[R]
21st day in current month
.TP
\f[CR]yesterday, today, tomorrow\f[R]
\-1, 0, 1 days from today
.TP
\f[CR]last/this/next day/week/month/quarter/year\f[R]
\-1, 0, 1 periods from the current period
.TP
\f[CR]in n days/weeks/months/quarters/years\f[R]
n periods from the current period
.TP
\f[CR]n days/weeks/months/quarters/years ahead\f[R]
n periods from the current period
.TP
\f[CR]n days/weeks/months/quarters/years ago\f[R]
\-n periods from the current period
.TP
\f[CR]20181201\f[R]
8 digit YYYYMMDD with valid year month and day
.TP
\f[CR]201812\f[R]
6 digit YYYYMM with valid year and month
.PP
Dates with no separators are allowed but might give surprising results
if mistyped:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]20181301\f[R] (YYYYMMDD with an invalid month) is parsed as an
eight\-digit year
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]20181232\f[R] (YYYYMMDD with an invalid day) gives a parse error
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]201801012\f[R] (a valid YYYYMMDD followed by additional digits)
gives a parse error
.PP
The meaning of relative dates depends on today\[aq]s date.
If you need to test or reproduce old reports, you can use the
\f[CR]\-\-today\f[R] option to override that.
(Except for periodic transaction rules, which are not affected by
\f[CR]\-\-today\f[R].)
.SS Report intervals
A report interval can be specified so that reports like register,
balance or activity become multi\-period, showing each subperiod as a
separate row or column.
.PP
The following standard intervals can be enabled with command\-line
flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-D/\-\-daily\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-W/\-\-weekly\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-M/\-\-monthly\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-Q/\-\-quarterly\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-Y/\-\-yearly\f[R]
.PP
More complex intervals can be specified using \f[CR]\-p/\-\-period\f[R],
described below.
.SS Date adjustments
.SS Start date adjustment
If you let hledger infer a report\[aq]s start date, it will adjust the
date to the previous natural boundary of the report interval, for
convenient periodic reports.
(If you don\[aq]t want that, specify a start date.)
.PP
For example, if the journal\[aq]s first transaction is on january 10th,
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register\f[R] (no report interval) will start the report
on january 10th.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register \-\-monthly\f[R] will start the report on the
previous month boundary, january 1st.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register \-\-monthly \-\-begin 1/5\f[R] will start the
report on january 5th [1].
.PP
Also if you are generating transactions or budget goals with periodic
transaction rules, their start date may be adjusted in a similar way (in
certain situations).
.SS End date adjustment
A report\[aq]s end date is always adjusted to include a whole number of
intervals, so that the last subperiod has the same length as the others.
.PP
For example, if the journal\[aq]s last transaction is on february 20th,
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register\f[R] will end the report on february 20th.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register \-\-monthly\f[R] will end the report at the end
of february.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register \-\-monthly \-\-end 2/14\f[R] also will end the
report at the end of february.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]hledger register \-\-monthly \-\-begin 1/5 \-\-end 2/14\f[R] will
end the report on march 4th [1].
.PP
[1] Since hledger 1.29.
.SS Period headings
With non\-standard subperiods, hledger will show
\[dq]STARTDATE..ENDDATE\[dq] headings.
With standard subperiods (ie, starting on a natural interval boundary),
you\[aq]ll see more compact headings, which are usually preferable.
(Though month names will be in english, currently.)
.PP
So if you are specifying a start date and you want compact headings:
choose a start of year for yearly reports, a start of quarter for
quarterly reports, a start of month for monthly reports, etc.
(Remember, you can write eg \f[CR]\-b 2024\f[R] or \f[CR]1/1\f[R] as a
shortcut for a start of year, or \f[CR]2024\-04\f[R] or
\f[CR]202404\f[R] or \f[CR]Apr\f[R] for a start of month or quarter.)
.PP
For weekly reports, choose a date that\[aq]s a Monday.
(You can try different dates until you see the short headings, or write
eg \f[CR]\-b \[aq]3 weeks ago\[aq]\f[R].)
.SS Period expressions
The \f[CR]\-p/\-\-period\f[R] option specifies a period expression,
which is a compact way of expressing a start date, end date, and/or
report interval.
.PP
Here\[aq]s a period expression with a start and end date (specifying the
first quarter of 2009):
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l.
T{
\f[CR]\-p \[dq]from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1\[dq]\f[R]
T}
.TE
.PP
Several keywords like \[dq]from\[dq] and \[dq]to\[dq] are supported for
readability; these are optional.
\[dq]to\[dq] can also be written as \[dq]..\[dq] or \[dq]\-\[dq].
The spaces are also optional, as long as you don\[aq]t run two dates
together.
So the following are equivalent to the above:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l.
T{
\f[CR]\-p \[dq]2009/1/1 2009/4/1\[dq]\f[R]
T}
T{

T}
T{
\f[CR]\-p2009/1/1..2009/4/1\f[R]
T}
.TE
.PP
Dates are smart dates, so if the current year is 2009, these are also
equivalent to the above:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l.
T{
\f[CR]\-p \[dq]1/1 4/1\[dq]\f[R]

T}
T{
\f[CR]\-p \[dq]this year to 4/1\[dq]\f[R]

.PP
If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be the
earliest or latest transaction date in the journal:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l l.

.SS Period expressions with a report interval
A period expression can also begin with a report interval, separated
from the start/end dates (if any) by a space or the word \f[CR]in\f[R]:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l.
T{
\f[CR]\-p \[dq]weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1\[dq]\f[R]

.SH Depth
With the \f[CR]\-\-depth NUM\f[R] option (short form: \f[CR]\-NUM\f[R]),
reports will show accounts only to the specified depth, hiding deeper
subaccounts.
Use this when you want a summary with less detail.
This flag has the same effect as a \f[CR]depth:\f[R] query argument:
\f[CR]depth:2\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-depth=2\f[R] or \f[CR]\-2\f[R] are
equivalent.
.SH Queries
One of hledger\[aq]s strengths is being able to quickly report on a
precise subset of your data.
Most hledger commands accept query arguments, to restrict their scope.
Multiple query terms can be provided to build up a more complex query.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default, a query term is interpreted as a case\-insensitive substring
pattern for matching account names:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]car:fuel\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]dining groceries\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Patterns containing spaces or other special characters must be enclosed
in single or double quotes:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]\[aq]personal care\[aq]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
These patterns are actually regular expressions, so you can add regexp
metacharacters for more precision (see \[dq]Regular expressions\[dq]
above for details):

.SS Query types
Here are the types of query term available.
Remember these can also be prefixed with \f[B]\f[CB]not:\f[B]\f[R] to
convert them into a negative match.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]acct:REGEX\f[B]\f[R] or \f[B]\f[CB]REGEX\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match account names containing this case insensitive regular expression.
This is the default query type, so we usually don\[aq]t bother writing
the \[dq]acct:\[dq] prefix.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]amt:N, amt:<N, amt:<=N, amt:>N, amt:>=N\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match postings with a single\-commodity amount equal to, less than, or
greater than N. (Postings with multi\-commodity amounts are not tested
and will always match.)
The comparison has two modes: if N is preceded by a + or \- sign (or is
0), the two signed numbers are compared.
Otherwise, the absolute magnitudes are compared, ignoring sign.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]code:REGEX\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match by transaction code (eg check number).
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]cur:REGEX\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match postings or transactions including any amounts whose
currency/commodity symbol is fully matched by REGEX.
(For a partial match, use \f[CR].*REGEX.*\f[R]).
Note, to match special characters which are regex\-significant, you need
to escape them with \f[CR]\[rs]\f[R].
And for characters which are significant to your shell you may need one
more level of escaping.
So eg to match the dollar sign:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]hledger print cur:\[rs]\[rs]$\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]desc:REGEX\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match transaction descriptions.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]date:PERIODEXPR\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match dates (or with the \f[CR]\-\-date2\f[R] flag, secondary dates)
within the specified period.
PERIODEXPR is a period expression with no report interval.
Examples:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]date:2016\f[R], \f[CR]date:thismonth\f[R],
\f[CR]date:2/1\-2/15\f[R], \f[CR]date:2021\-07\-27..nextquarter\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]date2:PERIODEXPR\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match secondary dates within the specified period (independent of the
\f[CR]\-\-date2\f[R] flag).
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]depth:N\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match (or display, depending on command) accounts at or above this
depth.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]expr:\[dq]TERM AND NOT (TERM OR TERM)\[dq]\f[B]\f[R] (eg)
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match with a boolean combination of queries (which must be enclosed in
quotes).
See Combining query terms below.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]note:REGEX\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match transaction notes (the part of the description right of
\f[CR]|\f[R], or the whole description if there\[aq]s no \f[CR]|\f[R]).
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]payee:REGEX\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match transaction payee/payer names (the part of the description left of
\f[CR]|\f[R], or the whole description if there\[aq]s no \f[CR]|\f[R]).
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]real:, real:0\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match real or virtual postings respectively.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]status:, status:!, status:*\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match unmarked, pending, or cleared transactions respectively.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]type:TYPECODES\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match by account type (see Declaring accounts > Account types).
\f[CR]TYPECODES\f[R] is one or more of the single\-letter account type
codes \f[CR]ALERXCV\f[R], case insensitive.
Note \f[CR]type:A\f[R] and \f[CR]type:E\f[R] will also match their
respective subtypes \f[CR]C\f[R] (Cash) and \f[CR]V\f[R] (Conversion).
Certain kinds of account alias can disrupt account types, see Rewriting
accounts > Aliases and account types.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]tag:REGEX[=REGEX]\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Match by tag name, and optionally also by tag value.
(To match only by value, use \f[CR]tag:.=REGEX\f[R].)
.PP
When querying by tag, note that:
.IP \[bu] 2
Accounts also inherit the tags of their parent accounts
.IP \[bu] 2
Postings also inherit the tags of their account and their transaction
.IP \[bu] 2
Transactions also acquire the tags of their postings.
.PP
(\f[B]\f[CB]inacct:ACCTNAME\f[B]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
A special query term used automatically in hledger\-web only: tells
hledger\-web to show the transaction register for an account.)
.SS Combining query terms
When given multiple space\-separated query terms, most commands select
things which match:
.IP \[bu] 2
any of the description terms AND
.IP \[bu] 2
any of the account terms AND
.IP \[bu] 2
any of the status terms AND
.IP \[bu] 2
all the other terms.
.PP
The print command is a little different, showing transactions which:
.IP \[bu] 2
match any of the description terms AND
.IP \[bu] 2
have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND
.IP \[bu] 2
have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND
.IP \[bu] 2
match all the other terms.
.PP
We also support more complex boolean queries with the \f[CR]expr:\f[R]
prefix.
This allows one to combine query terms using \f[CR]and\f[R],
\f[CR]or\f[R], \f[CR]not\f[R] keywords (case insensitive), and to group
them by enclosing in parentheses.
.PP
Some examples:
.IP \[bu] 2
Exclude account names containing \[aq]food\[aq]:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]expr:\[dq]not food\[dq]\f[R] (\f[CR]not:food\f[R] is equivalent)
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Match things which have \[aq]cool\[aq] in the description and the
\[aq]A\[aq] tag:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]expr:\[dq]desc:cool and tag:A\[dq]\f[R]
(\f[CR]expr:\[dq]desc:cool tag:A\[dq]\f[R] is equivalent)
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Match things which either do not reference the \[aq]expenses:food\[aq]
account, or do have the \[aq]A\[aq] tag:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]expr:\[dq]not expenses:food or tag:A\[dq]\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Match things which either do not reference the \[aq]expenses:food\[aq]
account, or which reference the \[aq]expenses:drink\[aq] account and
also have the \[aq]A\[aq] tag:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]expr:\[dq]expenses:food or (expenses:drink and tag:A)\[dq]\f[R]
.RE
.PP
\f[CR]expr:\f[R] has a restriction: \f[CR]date:\f[R] queries may not be
used inside \f[CR]or\f[R] expressions.
That would allow disjoint report periods or disjoint result sets, with
unclear semantics for our reports.
.SS Queries and command options
Some queries can also be expressed as command\-line options:
\f[CR]depth:2\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR]\-\-depth 2\f[R],
\f[CR]date:2023\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR]\-p 2023\f[R], etc.
When you mix command options and query arguments, generally the
resulting query is their intersection.
.SS Queries and account aliases
When account names are rewritten with \f[CR]\-\-alias\f[R] or
\f[CR]alias\f[R], \f[CR]acct:\f[R] will match either the old or the new
account name.
.SS Queries and valuation
When amounts are converted to other commodities in cost or value
reports, \f[CR]cur:\f[R] and \f[CR]amt:\f[R] match the old commodity
symbol and the old amount quantity, not the new ones.
(Except in hledger 1.22, #1625.)
.SH Pivoting
Normally, hledger groups and sums amounts within each account.
The \f[CR]\-\-pivot FIELD\f[R] option substitutes some other transaction
field for account names, causing amounts to be grouped and summed by
that field\[aq]s value instead.
FIELD can be any of the transaction fields \f[CR]acct\f[R],
\f[CR]status\f[R], \f[CR]code\f[R], \f[CR]desc\f[R], \f[CR]payee\f[R],
\f[CR]note\f[R], or a tag name.
When pivoting on a tag and a posting has multiple values of that tag,
only the first value is displayed.
Values containing \f[CR]colon:separated:parts\f[R] will be displayed
hierarchically, like account names.
Multiple, colon\-delimited fields can be pivoted simultaneously,
generating a hierarchical account name.

.SH Generating data
hledger can enrich the data provided to it, or generate new data, in a
number of ways.
Mostly, this is done only if you request it:
.IP \[bu] 2
Missing amounts or missing costs in transactions are inferred
automatically when possible.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]\-\-infer\-equity\f[R] flag infers missing conversion equity
postings from \[at]/\[at]\[at] costs.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R] flag infers missing costs from
conversion equity postings.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]\-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R] flag infers \f[CR]P\f[R] price
directives from costs.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R] flag adds extra postings to transactions matched
by auto posting rules.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R] option generates transactions from periodic
transaction rules.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]balance \-\-budget\f[R] report infers budget goals from
periodic transaction rules.
.IP \[bu] 2
Commands like \f[CR]close\f[R], \f[CR]rewrite\f[R], and
\f[CR]hledger\-interest\f[R] generate transactions or postings.
.IP \[bu] 2
CSV data is converted to transactions by applying CSV conversion rules..
etc.
.PP
Such generated data is temporary, existing only at report time.
You can convert it to permanent recorded data by, eg, capturing the
output of \f[CR]hledger print\f[R] and saving it in your journal file.
This can sometimes be useful as a data entry aid.
.PP
If you are curious what data is being generated and why, run
\f[CR]hledger print \-x \-\-verbose\-tags\f[R].
\f[CR]\-x/\-\-explicit\f[R] shows inferred amounts and
\f[CR]\-\-verbose\-tags\f[R] adds tags like
\f[CR]generated\-transaction\f[R] (from periodic rules) and
\f[CR]generated\-posting\f[R], \f[CR]modified\f[R] (from auto posting
rules).
Similar hidden tags (with an underscore prefix) are always present,
also, so you can always match such data with queries like
\f[CR]tag:generated\f[R] or \f[CR]tag:modified\f[R].
.SH Forecasting
Forecasting, or speculative future reporting, can be useful for
estimating future balances, or for exploring different future scenarios.
.PP
The simplest and most flexible way to do it with hledger is to manually
record a bunch of future\-dated transactions.
You could keep these in a separate \f[CR]future.journal\f[R] and include
that with \f[CR]\-f\f[R] only when you want to see them.
.SS \-\-forecast
There is another way: with the \f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R] option, hledger
can generate temporary \[dq]forecast transactions\[dq] for reporting
purposes, according to periodic transaction rules defined in the
journal.
Each rule can generate multiple recurring transactions, so by changing
one rule you can change many forecasted transactions.
.PP
Forecast transactions usually start after ordinary transactions end.
By default, they begin after your latest\-dated ordinary transaction, or
today, whichever is later, and they end six months from today.
(The exact rules are a little more complicated, and are given below.)
.PP
This is the \[dq]forecast period\[dq], which need not be the same as the
report period.
You can override it \- eg to forecast farther into the future, or to
force forecast transactions to overlap your ordinary transactions \- by
giving the \-\-forecast option a period expression argument, like
\f[CR]\-\-forecast=..2099\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-\-forecast=2023\-02\-15..\f[R].
Note that the \f[CR]=\f[R] is required.
.SS Inspecting forecast transactions
\f[CR]print\f[R] is the best command for inspecting and troubleshooting
forecast transactions.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
\[ti] monthly from 2022\-12\-20    rent
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent           $1000

.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-forecast \-\-today=2023/4/21
2023\-05\-20 rent
    ; generated\-transaction: \[ti] monthly from 2022\-12\-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023\-06\-20 rent
    ; generated\-transaction: \[ti] monthly from 2022\-12\-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023\-07\-20 rent
    ; generated\-transaction: \[ti] monthly from 2022\-12\-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023\-08\-20 rent
    ; generated\-transaction: \[ti] monthly from 2022\-12\-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023\-09\-20 rent
    ; generated\-transaction: \[ti] monthly from 2022\-12\-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000
.EE
.PP
Here there are no ordinary transactions, so the forecasted transactions
begin on the first occurrence after today\[aq]s date.
(You won\[aq]t normally use \f[CR]\-\-today\f[R]; it\[aq]s just to make
these examples reproducible.)
.SS Forecast reports
Forecast transactions affect all reports, as you would expect.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger areg rent \-\-forecast \-\-today=2023/4/21
Transactions in expenses:rent and subaccounts:
2023\-05\-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $1000

.SS Forecast tags
Forecast transactions generated by \-\-forecast have a hidden tag,
\f[CR]_generated\-transaction\f[R].
So if you ever need to match forecast transactions, you could use
\f[CR]tag:_generated\-transaction\f[R] (or just
\f[CR]tag:generated\f[R]) in a query.
.PP
For troubleshooting, you can add the \f[CR]\-\-verbose\-tags\f[R] flag.
Then, visible \f[CR]generated\-transaction\f[R] tags will be added also,
so you can view them with the \f[CR]print\f[R] command.
Their value indicates which periodic rule was responsible.
.SS Forecast period, in detail
Forecast start/end dates are chosen so as to do something useful by
default in almost all situations, while also being flexible.
Here are (with luck) the exact rules, to help with troubleshooting:
.PP
The forecast period starts on:
.IP \[bu] 2
the later of
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
the start date in the periodic transaction rule
.IP \[bu] 2
the start date in \f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R]\[aq]s argument
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
otherwise (if those are not available): the later of
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
the report start date specified with
\f[CR]\-b\f[R]/\f[CR]\-p\f[R]/\f[CR]date:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
the day after the latest ordinary transaction in the journal
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
otherwise (if none of these are available): today.
.PP
The forecast period ends on:
.IP \[bu] 2
the earlier of
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
the end date in the periodic transaction rule
.IP \[bu] 2
the end date in \f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R]\[aq]s argument
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
otherwise: the report end date specified with
\f[CR]\-e\f[R]/\f[CR]\-p\f[R]/\f[CR]date:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
otherwise: 180 days (\[ti]6 months) from today.
.SS Forecast troubleshooting
When \-\-forecast is not doing what you expect, one of these tips should
help:
.IP \[bu] 2
Remember to use the \f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R] option.
.IP \[bu] 2
Remember to have at least one periodic transaction rule in your journal.
.IP \[bu] 2
Test with \f[CR]print \-\-forecast\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Check for typos or too\-restrictive start/end dates in your periodic
transaction rule.
.IP \[bu] 2
Leave at least 2 spaces between the rule\[aq]s period expression and
description fields.
.IP \[bu] 2
Check for future\-dated ordinary transactions suppressing forecasted
transactions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Try setting explicit report start and/or end dates with \f[CR]\-b\f[R],
\f[CR]\-e\f[R], \f[CR]\-p\f[R] or \f[CR]date:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Try adding the \f[CR]\-E\f[R] flag to encourage display of empty
periods/zero transactions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Try setting explicit forecast start and/or end dates with
\f[CR]\-\-forecast=START..END\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Consult Forecast period, in detail, above.
.IP \[bu] 2
Check inside the engine: add \f[CR]\-\-debug=2\f[R] (eg).
.SH Budgeting
With the balance command\[aq]s \f[CR]\-\-budget\f[R] report, each
periodic transaction rule generates recurring budget goals in specified
accounts, and goals and actual performance can be compared.
See the balance command\[aq]s doc below.
.PP
You can generate budget goals and forecast transactions at the same
time, from the same or different periodic transaction rules:
\f[CR]hledger bal \-M \-\-budget \-\-forecast ...\f[R]
.PP
See also: Budgeting and Forecasting.
.SH Amount formatting
.SS Commodity display style
For the amounts in each commodity, hledger chooses a consistent display
style (symbol placement, decimal mark and digit group marks, number of
decimal digits) to use in most reports.
This is inferred as follows:
.PP
First, if there\[aq]s a \f[CR]D\f[R] directive declaring a default
commodity, that commodity symbol and amount format is applied to all
no\-symbol amounts in the journal.
.PP
Then each commodity\[aq]s display style is determined from its
\f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive.
We recommend always declaring commodities with \f[CR]commodity\f[R]
directives, since they help ensure consistent display styles and
precisions, and bring other benefits such as error checking for
commodity symbols.
Here\[aq]s an example:
.IP
.EX
# Set display styles (and decimal marks, for parsing, if there is no decimal\-mark directive)
# for the $, EUR, INR and no\-symbol commodities:
commodity $1,000.00
commodity EUR 1.000,00
commodity INR 9,99,99,999.00
commodity 1 000 000.9455
.EE
.PP
But for convenience, if a \f[CR]commodity\f[R] directive is not present,
hledger infers a commodity\[aq]s display styles from its amounts as they
are written in the journal (excluding cost amounts and amounts in
periodic transaction rules or auto posting rules).
It uses
.IP \[bu] 2
the symbol placement and decimal mark of the first amount seen
.IP \[bu] 2
the digit group marks of the first amount with digit group marks
.IP \[bu] 2
and the maximum number of decimal digits seen across all amounts.
.PP
And as fallback if no applicable amounts are found, it would use a
default style, like \f[CR]$1000.00\f[R] (symbol on the left with no
space, period as decimal mark, and two decimal digits).
.PP
Finally, commodity styles can be overridden by the
\f[CR]\-c/\-\-commodity\-style\f[R] command line option.
.SS Rounding
Amounts are stored internally as decimal numbers with up to 255 decimal
places.
They are displayed with their original journal precisions by print and
print\-like reports, and rounded to their display precision (the number
of decimal digits specified by the commodity display style) by other
reports.
When rounding, hledger uses banker\[aq]s rounding (it rounds to the
nearest even digit).
So eg 0.5 displayed with zero decimal digits appears as \[dq]0\[dq].
.SS Trailing decimal marks
If you\[aq]re wondering why your \f[CR]print\f[R] report sometimes shows
trailing decimal marks, with no decimal digits; it does this when
showing amounts that have digit group marks but no decimal digits, to
disambiguate them and allow them to be re\-parsed reliably (see Decimal
marks).
Eg:
.IP
.EX
commodity $1,000.00

2023\-01\-02
    (a)      $1000
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print
2023\-01\-02
    (a)        $1,000.
.EE
.PP
If this is a problem (eg when exporting to Ledger), you can avoid it by
disabling digit group marks, eg with \-c/\-\-commodity (for each
affected commodity):

.SS Amount parseability
More generally, hledger output falls into three rough categories, which
format amounts a little bit differently to suit different consumers:
.PP
\f[B]1.
\[dq]hledger\-readable output\[dq] \- should be readable by hledger (and
by humans)\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
This is produced by reports that show full journal entries:
\f[CR]print\f[R], \f[CR]import\f[R], \f[CR]close\f[R],
\f[CR]rewrite\f[R] etc.
.IP \[bu] 2
It shows amounts with their original journal precisions, which may not
be consistent.
.IP \[bu] 2
It adds a trailing decimal mark when needed to avoid showing ambiguous
amounts.
.IP \[bu] 2
It can be parsed reliably (by hledger and ledger2beancount at least, but
perhaps not by Ledger..)
.PP
\f[B]2.
\[dq]human\-readable output\[dq] \- usually for humans\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
This is produced by all other reports.
.IP \[bu] 2
It shows amounts with standard display precisions, which will be
consistent within each commodity.
.IP \[bu] 2
It shows ambiguous amounts unmodified.
.IP \[bu] 2
It can be parsed reliably in the context of a known report (when you
know decimals are consistently not being shown, you can assume a single
mark is a digit group mark).
.PP
\f[B]3.
\[dq]machine\-readable output\[dq] \- usually for other software\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
This is produced by all reports when an output format like
\f[CR]csv\f[R], \f[CR]tsv\f[R], \f[CR]json\f[R], or \f[CR]sql\f[R] is
selected.
.IP \[bu] 2
It shows amounts as 1 or 2 do, but without digit group marks.
.IP \[bu] 2
It can be parsed reliably (if needed, the decimal mark can be changed
with \-c/\-\-commodity\-style).
.SH Cost reporting
In some transactions \- for example a currency conversion, or a purchase
or sale of stock \- one commodity is exchanged for another.
In these transactions there is a conversion rate, also called the cost
(when buying) or selling price (when selling).
In hledger docs we just say \[dq]cost\[dq], for convenience; feel free
to mentally translate to \[dq]conversion rate\[dq] or \[dq]selling
price\[dq] if helpful.
.SS Recording costs
We\[aq]ll explore several ways of recording transactions involving
costs.
These are also summarised at hledger Cookbook > Cost notation.
.PP
Costs can be recorded explicitly in the journal, using the
\f[CR]\[at] UNITCOST\f[R] or \f[CR]\[at]\[at] TOTALCOST\f[R] notation
described in Journal > Costs:
.PP
\f[B]Variant 1\f[R]
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01
  assets:dollars    $\-135
  assets:euros       €100 \[at] $1.35   ; $1.35 per euro (unit cost)
.EE
.PP
\f[B]Variant 2\f[R]
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01
  assets:dollars    $\-135
  assets:euros       €100 \[at]\[at] $135   ; $135 total cost
.EE
.PP
Typically, writing the unit cost (variant 1) is preferable; it can be
more effort, requiring more attention to decimal digits; but it reveals
the per\-unit cost basis, and makes stock sales easier.
.PP
Costs can also be left implicit, and hledger will infer the cost that is
consistent with a balanced transaction:
.PP
\f[B]Variant 3\f[R]
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01
  assets:dollars    $\-135
  assets:euros       €100
.EE
.PP
Here, hledger will attach a \f[CR]\[at]\[at] €100\f[R] cost to the first
amount (you can see it with \f[CR]hledger print \-x\f[R]).
This form looks convenient, but there are downsides:
.IP \[bu] 2
It sacrifices some error checking.
For example, if you accidentally wrote €10 instead of €100, hledger
would not be able to detect the mistake.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is sensitive to the order of postings \- if they were reversed, a
different entry would be inferred and reports would be different.
.IP \[bu] 2
The per\-unit cost basis is not easy to read.
.PP
So generally this kind of entry is not recommended.
You can make sure you have none of these by using \f[CR]\-s\f[R] (strict
mode), or by running \f[CR]hledger check balanced\f[R].
.SS Reporting at cost
Now when you add the \f[CR]\-B\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-cost\f[R] flag to reports
(\[dq]B\[dq] is from Ledger\[aq]s \-B/\-\-basis/\-\-cost flag), any
amounts which have been annotated with costs will be converted to their
cost\[aq]s commodity (in the report output).
Ie they will be displayed \[dq]at cost\[dq] or \[dq]at sale price\[dq].
.PP
Some things to note:
.IP \[bu] 2
Costs are attached to specific posting amounts in specific transactions,
and once recorded they do not change.
This contrasts with market prices, which are ambient and fluctuating.
.IP \[bu] 2
Conversion to cost is performed before conversion to market value
(described below).
.SS Equity conversion postings
There is a problem with the entries above \- they are not conventional
Double Entry Bookkeeping (DEB) notation, and because of the
\[dq]magical\[dq] transformation of one commodity into another, they
cause an imbalance in the Accounting Equation.
This shows up as a non\-zero grand total in balance reports like
\f[CR]hledger bse\f[R].
.PP
For most hledger users, this doesn\[aq]t matter in practice and can
safely be ignored !
But if you\[aq]d like to learn more, keep reading.
.PP
Conventional DEB uses an extra pair of equity postings to balance the
transaction.
Of course you can do this in hledger as well:
.PP
\f[B]Variant 4\f[R]
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01
    assets:dollars      $\-135
    assets:euros         €100
    equity:conversion    $135
    equity:conversion   €\-100
.EE
.PP
Now the transaction is perfectly balanced according to standard DEB, and
\f[CR]hledger bse\f[R]\[aq]s total will not be disrupted.
.PP
And, hledger can still infer the cost for cost reporting, but it\[aq]s
not done by default \- you must add the \f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R] flag
like so:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-infer\-costs
2022\-01\-01 one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
    assets:dollars       $\-135 \[at]\[at] €100
    assets:euros                  €100
    equity:conversion             $135
    equity:conversion            €\-100
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger bal \-\-infer\-costs \-B

                €100  assets:euros                                                                                                                                                
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-                                                                                                                                                              
                   0                                                                                                                                                              
.EE
.PP
Here are some downsides of this kind of entry:
.IP \[bu] 2
The per\-unit cost basis is not easy to read.
.IP \[bu] 2
Instead of \f[CR]\-B\f[R] you must remember to type
\f[CR]\-B \-\-infer\-costs\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R] works only where hledger can identify the
two equity:conversion postings and match them up with the two
non\-equity postings.
So writing the journal entry in a particular format becomes more
important.
More on this below.
.SS Inferring equity conversion postings
Can we go in the other direction ?
Yes, if you have transactions written with the \[at]/\[at]\[at] cost
notation, hledger can infer the missing equity postings, if you add the
\f[CR]\-\-infer\-equity\f[R] flag.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01
  assets:dollars  \-$135
  assets:euros     €100 \[at] $1.35
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-\-infer\-equity
2022\-01\-01
    assets:dollars                    $\-135
    assets:euros               €100 \[at] $1.35
    equity:conversion:$\-€:€           €\-100
    equity:conversion:$\-€:$         $135.00
.EE
.PP
The equity account names will be \[dq]equity:conversion:A\-B:A\[dq] and
\[dq]equity:conversion:A\-B:B\[dq] where A is the alphabetically first
commodity symbol.
You can customise the \[dq]equity:conversion\[dq] part by declaring an
account with the \f[CR]V\f[R]/\f[CR]Conversion\f[R] account type.
.PP
Note you will need to add account declarations for these to your
journal, if you use \f[CR]check accounts\f[R] or
\f[CR]check \-\-strict\f[R].
.SS Combining costs and equity conversion postings
Finally, you can use both the \[at]/\[at]\[at] cost notation and equity
postings at the same time.
This in theory gives the best of all worlds \- preserving the accounting
equation, revealing the per\-unit cost basis, and providing more
flexibility in how you write the entry:
.PP
\f[B]Variant 5\f[R]
.IP
.EX
2022\-01\-01 one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
    assets:dollars      $\-135
    equity:conversion    $135
    equity:conversion   €\-100
    assets:euros         €100 \[at] $1.35
.EE
.PP
All the other variants above can (usually) be rewritten to this final
form with:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print \-x \-\-infer\-costs \-\-infer\-equity
.EE
.PP
Downsides:
.IP \[bu] 2
The precise format of the journal entry becomes more important.
If hledger can\[aq]t detect and match up the cost and equity postings,
it will give a transaction balancing error.
.IP \[bu] 2
The add command does not yet accept this kind of entry (#2056).
.IP \[bu] 2
This is the most verbose form.
.SS Requirements for detecting equity conversion postings
\f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R] has certain requirements (unlike
\f[CR]\-\-infer\-equity\f[R], which always works).
It will infer costs only in transactions with:
.IP \[bu] 2
Two non\-equity postings, in different commodities.
Their order is significant: the cost will be added to the first of them.
.IP \[bu] 2
Two postings to equity conversion accounts, next to one another, which
balance the two non\-equity postings.
This balancing is checked to the same precision (number of decimal
places) used in the conversion posting\[aq]s amount.
Equity conversion accounts are:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
any accounts declared with account type
\f[CR]V\f[R]/\f[CR]Conversion\f[R], or their subaccounts
.IP \[bu] 2
otherwise, accounts named \f[CR]equity:conversion\f[R],
\f[CR]equity:trade\f[R], or \f[CR]equity:trading\f[R], or their
subaccounts.
.RE
.PP
And multiple such four\-posting groups can coexist within a single
transaction.
When \f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R] fails, it does not infer a cost in that
transaction, and does not raise an error (ie, it infers costs where it
can).
.PP
Reading variant 5 journal entries, combining cost notation and equity
postings, has all the same requirements.
When reading such an entry fails, hledger raises an \[dq]unbalanced
transaction\[dq] error.
.SS Infer cost and equity by default ?
Should \f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R] and \f[CR]\-\-infer\-equity\f[R] be
enabled by default ?
Try using them always, eg with a shell alias:
.IP
.EX
alias h=\[dq]hledger \-\-infer\-equity \-\-infer\-costs\[dq]
.EE
.PP
and let us know what problems you find.
.PP
.SH Value reporting
Instead of reporting amounts in their original commodity, hledger can
convert them to cost/sale amount (using the conversion rate recorded in
the transaction), and/or to market value (using some market price on a
certain date).
This is controlled by the \f[CR]\-\-value=TYPE[,COMMODITY]\f[R] option,
which will be described below.
We also provide the simpler \f[CR]\-V\f[R] and \f[CR]\-X COMMODITY\f[R]
options, and often one of these is all you need:
.SS \-V: Value
The \f[CR]\-V/\-\-market\f[R] flag converts amounts to market value in
their default \f[I]valuation commodity\f[R], using the market prices in
effect on the \f[I]valuation date(s)\f[R], if any.
More on these in a minute.
.SS \-X: Value in specified commodity
The \f[CR]\-X/\-\-exchange=COMM\f[R] option is like \f[CR]\-V\f[R],
except you tell it which currency you want to convert to, and it tries
to convert everything to that.
.SS Valuation date
Market prices can change from day to day.
hledger will use the prices on a particular valuation date (or on more
than one date).
By default hledger uses \[dq]end\[dq] dates for valuation.
More specifically:
.IP \[bu] 2
For single period reports (including normal print and register reports):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
If an explicit report end date is specified, that is used
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise the latest transaction date or P directive date is used (even
if it\[aq]s in the future)
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
For multiperiod reports, each period is valued on its last day.
.PP
This can be customised with the \-\-value option described below, which
can select either \[dq]then\[dq], \[dq]end\[dq], \[dq]now\[dq], or
\[dq]custom\[dq] dates.
(Note, this has a bug in hledger\-ui <=1.31: turning on valuation with
the \f[CR]V\f[R] key always resets it to \[dq]end\[dq].)
.SS Finding market price
To convert a commodity A to its market value in another commodity B,
hledger looks for a suitable market price (exchange rate) as follows, in
this order of preference:
.IP "1." 3
A \f[I]declared market price\f[R] or \f[I]inferred market price\f[R]:
A\[aq]s latest market price in B on or before the valuation date as
declared by a P directive, or (with the
\f[CR]\-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R] flag) inferred from costs.
\
.IP "2." 3
A \f[I]reverse market price\f[R]: the inverse of a declared or inferred
market price from B to A.
.IP "3." 3
A \f[I]forward chain of market prices\f[R]: a synthetic price formed by
combining the shortest chain of \[dq]forward\[dq] (only 1 above) market
prices, leading from A to B.
.IP "4." 3
\f[I]Any chain of market prices\f[R]: a chain of any market prices,
including both forward and reverse prices (1 and 2 above), leading from
A to B.
.PP
There is a limit to the length of these price chains; if hledger reaches
that length without finding a complete chain or exhausting all
possibilities, it will give up (with a \[dq]gave up\[dq] message visible
in \f[CR]\-\-debug=2\f[R] output).
That limit is currently 1000.
.PP
Amounts for which no suitable market price can be found, are not
converted.
.SS \-\-infer\-market\-prices: market prices from transactions
Normally, market value in hledger is fully controlled by, and requires,
P directives in your journal.
Since adding and updating those can be a chore, and since transactions
usually take place at close to market value, why not use the recorded
costs as additional market prices (as Ledger does) ?
Adding the \f[CR]\-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R] flag to \f[CR]\-V\f[R],
\f[CR]\-X\f[R] or \f[CR]\-\-value\f[R] enables this.
.PP
So for example, \f[CR]hledger bs \-V \-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R] will
get market prices both from P directives and from transactions.
If both occur on the same day, the P directive takes precedence.
.PP
There is a downside: value reports can sometimes be affected in
confusing/undesired ways by your journal entries.
If this happens to you, read all of this Value reporting section
carefully, and try adding \f[CR]\-\-debug\f[R] or \f[CR]\-\-debug=2\f[R]
to troubleshoot.
.PP
\f[CR]\-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R] can infer market prices from:
.IP \[bu] 2
multicommodity transactions with explicit prices
(\f[CR]\[at]\f[R]/\f[CR]\[at]\[at]\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
multicommodity transactions with implicit prices (no \f[CR]\[at]\f[R],
two commodities, unbalanced).
(With these, the order of postings matters.
\f[CR]hledger print \-x\f[R] can be useful for troubleshooting.)
.IP \[bu] 2
multicommodity transactions with equity postings, if cost is inferred
with \f[CR]\-\-infer\-costs\f[R].
.PP
There is a limitation (bug) currently: when a valuation commodity is not
specified, prices inferred with \f[CR]\-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R] do
not help select a default valuation commodity, as \f[CR]P\f[R] prices
would.
So conversion might not happen because no valuation commodity was
detected (\f[CR]\-\-debug=2\f[R] will show this).
To be safe, specify the valuation commmodity, eg:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-X EUR \-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R], not
\f[CR]\-V \-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-value=then,EUR \-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R], not
\f[CR]\-\-value=then \-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R]
.PP
Signed costs and market prices can be confusing.

.IP "2." 3
The price commodity from the latest P\-declared market price for A on

.SS Interaction of valuation and queries
When matching postings based on queries in the presence of valuation,
the following happens:
.IP "1." 3
The query is separated into two parts:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 3
the currency (\f[CR]cur:\f[R]) or amount (\f[CR]amt:\f[R]).
.IP "2." 3
all other parts.
.RE
.IP "2." 3
The postings are matched to the currency and amount queries based on
pre\-valued amounts.
.IP "3." 3
Valuation is applied to the postings.
.IP "4." 3
The postings are matched to the other parts of the query based on
post\-valued amounts.

.SH Help commands
.SS help
Show the hledger user manual with \f[CR]info\f[R], \f[CR]man\f[R], or a
pager.
With a (case insensitive) TOPIC argument, try to open it at that section
heading.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
  \-i                      show the manual with info
  \-m                      show the manual with man
  \-p                      show the manual with $PAGER or less
                          (less is always used if TOPIC is specified)
.EE
.PP
This command shows the hledger manual built in to your hledger
executable.
It can be useful when offline, or when you prefer the terminal to a web
browser, or when the appropriate hledger manual or viewers are not
installed properly on your system.
.PP
By default it chooses the best viewer found in $PATH, trying in this
order: \f[CR]info\f[R], \f[CR]man\f[R], \f[CR]$PAGER\f[R],
\f[CR]less\f[R], \f[CR]more\f[R], stdout.
(If a TOPIC is specified, \f[CR]$PAGER\f[R] and \f[CR]more\f[R] are not
tried.)
You can force the use of info, man, or a pager with the \f[CR]\-i\f[R],
\f[CR]\-m\f[R], or \f[CR]\-p\f[R] flags.
If no viewer can be found, or if running non\-interactively, it just
prints the manual to stdout.
.PP
When using \f[CR]info\f[R], TOPIC can match either the full heading or a
prefix.
If your \f[CR]info \-\-version\f[R] is < 6, you\[aq]ll need to upgrade
it, eg with \[aq]\f[CR]brew install texinfo\f[R]\[aq] on mac.
.PP
When using \f[CR]man\f[R] or \f[CR]less\f[R], TOPIC must match the full
heading.
For a prefix match, you can write \[aq]\f[CR]TOPIC.*\f[R]\[aq].
.PP
Examples
.IP
.EX
$ hledger help \-h                 # show the help command\[aq]s usage
$ hledger help                    # show the manual with info, man or $PAGER
$ hledger help \[aq]time periods\[aq]     # show the manual\[aq]s \[dq]Time periods\[dq] topic
$ hledger help \[aq]time periods\[aq] \-m  # use man, even if info is installed
.EE
.SS demo
Play demos of hledger usage in the terminal, if asciinema is installed.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
  \-s \-\-speed=SPEED        playback speed (1 is original speed, .5 is half, 2
                          is double, etc (default: 2))
.EE
.PP
Run this command with no argument to list the demos.
To play a demo, write its number or a prefix or substring of its title.
Tips:
.PP
Make your terminal window large enough to see the demo clearly.
.PP
Use the \-s/\-\-speed SPEED option to set your preferred playback speed,
eg \f[CR]\-s4\f[R] to play at 4x original speed or \f[CR]\-s.5\f[R] to
play at half speed.
The default speed is 2x.
.PP
Other asciinema options can be added following a double dash, eg
\f[CR]\-\- \-i.1\f[R] to limit pauses or \f[CR]\-\- \-h\f[R] to list
asciinema\[aq]s other options.
.PP
During playback, several keys are available: SPACE to pause/unpause, .
to step forward (while paused), CTRL\-c quit.
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger demo               # list available demos
$ hledger demo 1             # play the first demo at default speed (2x)
$ hledger demo install \-s4   # play the \[dq]install\[dq] demo at 4x speed
.EE
.SH User interface commands
.SS ui
Runs hledger\-ui (if installed).
.SS web
Runs hledger\-web (if installed).
.SH Data entry commands
.SS add
Record new transactions with interactive prompting in the console.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
     \-\-no\-new\-accounts      don\[aq]t allow creating new accounts
.EE
.PP
Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor, or
generate them from CSV.
For more interactive data entry, there is the \f[CR]add\f[R] command,
which prompts interactively on the console for new transactions, and
appends them to the main journal file (which should be in journal
format).
Existing transactions are not changed.
This is one of the few hledger commands that writes to the journal file
(see also \f[CR]import\f[R]).
.PP
To use it, just run \f[CR]hledger add\f[R] and follow the prompts.
You can add as many transactions as you like; when you are finished,
enter \f[CR].\f[R] or press control\-d or control\-c to exit.
.PP
Features:
.IP \[bu] 2
add tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar (by
description) recent transaction (filtered by the query, if any) as a
template.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.
.IP \[bu] 2
Readline\-style edit keys can be used during data entry.
.IP \[bu] 2
The tab key will auto\-complete whenever possible \- accounts,
payees/descriptions, dates (\f[CR]yesterday\f[R], \f[CR]today\f[R],
\f[CR]tomorrow\f[R]).
If the input area is empty, it will insert the default value.
.IP \[bu] 2
A parenthesised transaction code may be entered following a date.
.IP \[bu] 2
Comments and tags may be entered following a description or amount.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you make a mistake, enter \f[CR]<\f[R] at any prompt to go one step
backward.
.IP \[bu] 2
Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when the terminal
supports it.
.PP
Notes:
.IP \[bu] 2
If you enter a number with no commodity symbol, and you have declared a
default commodity with a \f[CR]D\f[R] directive, you might expect
\f[CR]add\f[R] to add this symbol for you.
It does not do this; we assume that if you are using a \f[CR]D\f[R]
directive you prefer not to see the commodity symbol repeated on amounts
in the journal.
.PP
Examples:
.IP \[bu] 2
Record new transactions, saving to the default journal file:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]hledger add\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Add transactions to 2024.journal, but also load 2023.journal for
completions:

.PP
\f[CR]hledger add \-\-file 2024.journal \-\-file 2023.journal\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Provide answers for the first four prompts:
.RS 2
.PP
\f[CR]hledger add today \[aq]best buy\[aq] expenses:supplies \[aq]$20\[aq]\f[R]
.RE
.PP
There is a detailed tutorial at https://hledger.org/add.html.
.SS import
Import new transactions from one or more data files to the main journal.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
     \-\-catchup              just mark all transactions as already imported
     \-\-dry\-run              just show the transactions to be imported
.EE
.PP
This command detects new transactions in each FILE argument since it was
last run, and appends them to the main journal.
.PP
Or with \f[CR]\-\-dry\-run\f[R], it just print the transactions that
would be added.
.PP
Or with \f[CR]\-\-catchup\f[R], it just marks all of the FILEs\[aq]
current transactions as already imported.
.PP
This is one of the few hledger commands that writes to the journal file
(see also \f[CR]add\f[R]).
It only appends; existing data will not be changed.
.PP
The input files are specified as arguments, so to import one or more CSV
files to your main journal, you will run
\f[CR]hledger import bank.csv\f[R] or perhaps
\f[CR]hledger import *.csv\f[R].
.PP
Note you can import from any file format, though CSV files are the most
common import source, and these docs focus on that case.
The target file (main journal) should be in journal format.
.SS Date skipping
\f[CR]import\f[R] tries to import only the transactions which are new
since the last import, ignoring any that it has seen in previous runs.
So if your bank\[aq]s CSV includes the last three months of data, you
can download and \f[CR]import\f[R] it every month (or week, or day) and
only the new transactions will be imported each time.
.PP
It works as follows: for each imported \f[CR]FILE\f[R],
.IP \[bu] 2
It tries to read the latest date previously seen, from
\f[CR].latest.FILE\f[R] in the same directory
.IP \[bu] 2
Then it processes \f[CR]FILE\f[R], ignoring transactions on or before
that date
.PP
And after a successful import, unless \f[CR]\-\-dry\-run\f[R] was used,
it updates the \f[CR].latest.FILE\f[R](s) for next time.
This is a simple system that works for most real\-world CSV files; it
assumes the following are true, or true enough:
.IP "1." 3
the name of the input file is stable across successive downloads
.IP "2." 3
new items always have the newest dates
.IP "3." 3
item dates are stable across downloads
.IP "4." 3
the order of same\-date items is stable across downloads.
.PP
Tips:
.IP \[bu] 2
To help ensure a stable file name, remember you can use a CSV rules file
as an input file.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you have a bank whose CSV dates or ordering occasionally change, you
can reduce the chance of this happening in new transactions by importing
more often.
(If it happens in old transactions, that\[aq]s harmless.)
.PP
Note this is just one kind of \[dq]deduplication\[dq]: not reprocessing
the same dates across successive runs.
\f[CR]import\f[R] doesn\[aq]t detect other kinds of duplication, such as
the same transaction appearing multiple times within a single run, or a
new transaction that looks identical to a transaction already in the
journal.
(Because these can happen legitimately in real\-world data.)
.PP
Here\[aq]s a situation where you need to run \f[CR]import\f[R] with
care: say you download but forget to import \f[CR]bank.1.csv\f[R], and a
week later you download \f[CR]bank.2.csv\f[R] with some overlapping
data.
You should not process both of these as a single import
(\f[CR]hledger import bank.1.csv bank.2.csv\f[R]), because the
overlapping transactions would not be deduplicated.
Instead, import one file at a time, using the same filename each time:
.IP
.EX
$ mv bank.1.csv bank.csv; hledger import bank.csv
$ mv bank.2.csv bank.csv; hledger import bank.csv
.EE
.PP
Normally you don\[aq]t need to think about \f[CR].latest.*\f[R] files,
but you can create or modify them to catch up to a certain date, or
delete them to mark all transactions as new.
Their format is a single ISO\-format \f[CR]YYYY\-MM\-DD\f[R] date,
optionally repeated on multiple lines, meaning \[dq]I have seen the
transactions before this date, and this many of them on this date\[dq].
.PP
\f[CR]hledger print \-\-new\f[R] also uses and updates these
\f[CR].latest.*\f[R] files, but it is less often used.
.PP
Related: CSV > Working with CSV > Deduplicating, importing.
.SS Import testing
With \f[CR]\-\-dry\-run\f[R], the transactions that will be imported are
printed to the terminal, without updating your journal or state files.
The output is valid journal format, like the print command, so you can
re\-parse it.
Eg, to see any importable transactions which CSV rules have not
categorised:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger import \-\-dry bank.csv | hledger \-f\- \-I print unknown
.EE
.PP
or (live updating):
.IP
.EX
$ ls bank.csv* | entr bash \-c \[aq]echo ====; hledger import \-\-dry bank.csv | hledger \-f\- \-I print unknown\[aq]
.EE
.PP
Note: when importing from multiple files at once, it\[aq]s currently
possible for some .latest files to be updated successfully, while the
actual import fails because of a problem in one of the files, leaving
them out of sync (and causing some transactions to be missed).
To prevent this, do a \-\-dry\-run first and fix any problems before the
real import.
.SS Importing balance assignments
Entries added by import will have their posting amounts made explicit
(like \f[CR]hledger print \-x\f[R]).
This means that any balance assignments in imported files must be
evaluated; but, imported files don\[aq]t get to see the main file\[aq]s
account balances.
As a result, importing entries with balance assignments (eg from an
institution that provides only balances and not posting amounts) will
probably generate incorrect posting amounts.
To avoid this problem, use print instead of import:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger print IMPORTFILE [\-\-new] >> $LEDGER_FILE
.EE
.PP
(If you think import should leave amounts implicit like print does,
please test it and send a pull request.)
.SS Import and commodity styles
Amounts in entries added by import will be formatted according to the
journal\[aq]s canonical commodity styles, as declared by
\f[CR]commodity\f[R] directives or inferred from the journal\[aq]s
amounts.
.PP
Related: CSV > Amount decimal places.

.EE
.PP
This command lists account names.
By default it shows all known accounts, either used in transactions or
declared with account directives.
.PP
With query arguments, only matched account names and account names
referenced by matched postings are shown.
.PP
Or it can show just the used accounts
(\f[CR]\-\-used\f[R]/\f[CR]\-u\f[R]), the declared accounts
(\f[CR]\-\-declared\f[R]/\f[CR]\-d\f[R]), the accounts declared but not
used (\f[CR]\-\-unused\f[R]), the accounts used but not declared
(\f[CR]\-\-undeclared\f[R]), or the first account matched by an account
name pattern, if any (\f[CR]\-\-find\f[R]).
.PP
It shows a flat list by default.
With \f[CR]\-\-tree\f[R], it uses indentation to show the account
hierarchy.
In flat mode you can add \f[CR]\-\-drop N\f[R] to omit the first few
account name components.
Account names can be depth\-clipped with \f[CR]depth:N\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-\-depth N\f[R] or \f[CR]\-N\f[R].
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-types\f[R], it also shows each account\[aq]s type, if
it\[aq]s known.
(See Declaring accounts > Account types.)
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-positions\f[R], it also shows the file and line number of
each account\[aq]s declaration, if any, and the account\[aq]s overall
declaration order; these may be useful when troubleshooting account
display order.
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-directives\f[R], it adds the \f[CR]account\f[R] keyword,
showing valid account directives which can be pasted into a journal
file.
This is useful together with \f[CR]\-\-undeclared\f[R] when updating
your account declarations to satisfy \f[CR]hledger check accounts\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]\-\-find\f[R] flag can be used to look up a single account
name, in the same way that the \f[CR]aregister\f[R] command does.
It returns the alphanumerically\-first matched account name, or if none
can be found, it fails with a non\-zero exit code.

.PP
Transactions aren\[aq]t required to have a code, and missing or empty
codes will not be shown by default.
With the \f[CR]\-E\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-empty\f[R] flag, they will be printed
as blank lines.

Price amounts are always displayed with their full precision, except for
reverse prices which are limited to 8 decimal digits.
.PP
Prices can be filtered by a date:, cur: or amt: query.
.PP
Generally if you run this command with \-\-infer\-market\-prices
\-\-show\-reverse, it will show the same prices used internally to
calculate value reports.
But if in doubt, you can inspect those directly by running the value
report with \-\-debug=2.

.EE
.PP
The stats command shows summary information for the whole journal, or a
matched part of it.
With a reporting interval, it shows a report for each report period.
.PP
The default output is fairly impersonal, though it reveals the main file
name.
With \f[CR]\-v/\-\-verbose\f[R], more details are shown, like file
paths, included files, and commodity names.
.PP
It also shows some run time statistics:
.IP \[bu] 2
elapsed time
.IP \[bu] 2
throughput: the number of transactions processed per second
.IP \[bu] 2
live: the peak memory in use by the program to do its work
.IP \[bu] 2
alloc: the peak memory allocation from the OS as seen by GHC.
Measuring this externally, eg with GNU time, is more accurate; usually
that will be a larger number; sometimes (with swapping?)
smaller.
.PP
The \f[CR]stats\f[R] command\[aq]s run time is similar to that of a

The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from the
journal file, sorted by date (or with \f[CR]\-\-date2\f[R], by secondary
date).
.PP
Directives and inter\-transaction comments are not shown, currently.
This means the print command is somewhat lossy, and if you are using it
to reformat/regenerate your journal you should take care to also copy
over the directives and inter\-transaction comments.
.PP
Eg:
.IP

.EE
.SS print explicitness
Normally, whether posting amounts are implicit or explicit is preserved.
For example, when an amount is omitted in the journal, it will not
appear in the output.
Similarly, if a conversion cost is implied but not written, it will not
appear in the output.
.PP
You can use the \f[CR]\-x\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-explicit\f[R] flag to force
explicit display of all amounts and costs.
This can be useful for troubleshooting or for making your journal more
readable and robust against data entry errors.
\f[CR]\-x\f[R] is also implied by using any of
\f[CR]\-B\f[R],\f[CR]\-V\f[R],\f[CR]\-X\f[R],\f[CR]\-\-value\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]\-x\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-explicit\f[R] flag will cause any postings
with a multi\-commodity amount (which can arise when a multi\-commodity
transaction has an implicit amount) to be split into multiple
single\-commodity postings, keeping the output parseable.
.SS print amount style
Amounts are shown right\-aligned within each transaction (but not
aligned across all transactions; you can do that with ledger\-mode in
Emacs).
.PP
Amounts will be (mostly) normalised to their commodity display style:
their symbol placement, decimal mark, and digit group marks will be made
consistent.
By default, decimal digits are shown as they are written in the journal.
.PP
With the \f[CR]\-\-round\f[R] (\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]) option,
\f[CR]print\f[R] will try increasingly hard to display decimal digits
according to the commodity display styles:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-round=none\f[R] show amounts with original precisions
(default)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-round=soft\f[R] add/remove decimal zeros in amounts (except
costs)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-round=hard\f[R] round amounts (except costs), possibly hiding
significant digits
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-round=all\f[R] round all amounts and costs
.PP
\f[CR]soft\f[R] is good for non\-lossy cleanup, formatting amounts more
consistently where it\[aq]s safe to do so.
.PP
\f[CR]hard\f[R] and \f[CR]all\f[R] can cause \f[CR]print\f[R] to show
invalid unbalanced journal entries; they may be useful eg for stronger
cleanup, with manual fixups when needed.
.SS print parseability
print\[aq]s output is usually a valid hledger journal, and you can
process it again with a second hledger command.
This can be useful for certain kinds of search (though the same can be
achieved with \f[CR]expr:\f[R] queries now):
.IP
.EX
# Show running total of food expenses paid from cash.
# \-f\- reads from stdin. \-I/\-\-ignore\-assertions is sometimes needed.
$ hledger print assets:cash | hledger \-f\- \-I reg expenses:food
.EE
.PP
There are some situations where print\[aq]s output can become
unparseable:
.IP \[bu] 2
Value reporting affects posting amounts but not balance assertion or
balance assignment amounts, potentially causing those to fail.
.IP \[bu] 2
Auto postings can generate postings with too many missing amounts.
.IP \[bu] 2
Account aliases can generate bad account names.
.SS print, other features
With \f[CR]\-B\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-cost\f[R], amounts with costs are shown
converted to cost.
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-new\f[R], print shows only transactions it has not seen
on a previous run.
This uses the same deduplication system as the \f[CR]import\f[R]
command.
(See import\[aq]s docs for details.)
.PP
With \f[CR]\-m DESC\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-match=DESC\f[R], print shows one
recent transaction whose description is most similar to DESC.
DESC should contain at least two characters.
If there is no similar\-enough match, no transaction will be shown and
the program exit code will be non\-zero.
.SS print output format
This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are \f[CR]txt\f[R],
\f[CR]beancount\f[R] (\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]), \f[CR]csv\f[R],
\f[CR]tsv\f[R] (\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]), \f[CR]json\f[R] and
\f[CR]sql\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]beancount\f[R] format tries to produce Beancount\-compatible
output, as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
Transaction and postings with unmarked status are converted to cleared
(\f[CR]*\f[R]) status.
.IP \[bu] 2
Transactions\[aq] payee and note are backslash\-escaped and
double\-quote\-escaped and wrapped in double quotes.
.IP \[bu] 2
Transaction tags are copied to Beancount #tag format.
.IP \[bu] 2
Commodity symbols are converted to upper case, and a small number of
currency symbols like \f[CR]$\f[R] are converted to the corresponding
currency names.
.IP \[bu] 2
Account name parts are capitalised and unsupported characters are
replaced with \f[CR]\-\f[R].
If an account name part does not begin with a letter, or if the first
part is not Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, or Expenses, an error
is raised.
(Use \f[CR]\-\-alias\f[R] options to bring your accounts into
compliance.)
.IP \[bu] 2
An \f[CR]open\f[R] directive is generated for each account used, on the
earliest transaction date.
.PP
Some limitations:
.IP \[bu] 2
Balance assertions are removed.
.IP \[bu] 2
Balance assignments become missing amounts.
.IP \[bu] 2
Virtual and balanced virtual postings become regular postings.
.IP \[bu] 2
Directives are not converted.

.EE
.PP
\f[CR]aregister\f[R] shows the overall transactions affecting a
particular account (and any subaccounts).
Each report line represents one transaction in this account.
Transactions before the report start date are always included in the
running balance (\f[CR]\-\-historical\f[R] mode is always on).
.PP
This is a more \[dq]real world\[dq], bank\-like view than the
\f[CR]register\f[R] command (which shows individual postings, possibly
from multiple accounts, not necessarily in historical mode).
As a quick rule of thumb: \- use \f[CR]aregister\f[R] for reviewing and
reconciling real\-world asset/liability accounts \- use
\f[CR]register\f[R] for reviewing detailed revenues/expenses.
.PP
\f[CR]aregister\f[R] requires one argument: the account to report on.
You can write either the full account name, or a case\-insensitive
regular expression which will select the alphabetically first matched
account.
.PP
When there are multiple matches, the alphabetically\-first choice can be
surprising; eg if you have \f[CR]assets:per:checking 1\f[R] and
\f[CR]assets:biz:checking 2\f[R] accounts,
\f[CR]hledger areg checking\f[R] would select
\f[CR]assets:biz:checking 2\f[R].
It\[aq]s just a convenience to save typing, so if in doubt, write the
full account name, or a distinctive substring that matches uniquely.
.PP
Transactions involving subaccounts of this account will also be shown.
\f[CR]aregister\f[R] ignores depth limits, so its final total will
always match a balance report with similar arguments.
.PP
Any additional arguments form a query which will filter the transactions
shown.
Note some queries will disturb the running balance, causing it to be
different from the account\[aq]s real\-world running balance.
.PP
An example: this shows the transactions and historical running balance
during july, in the first account whose name contains
\[dq]checking\[dq]:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger areg checking date:jul
.EE
.PP
Each \f[CR]aregister\f[R] line item shows:
.IP \[bu] 2
the transaction\[aq]s date (or the relevant posting\[aq]s date if
different, see below)
.IP \[bu] 2
the names of all the other account(s) involved in this transaction
(probably abbreviated)
.IP \[bu] 2
the total change to this account\[aq]s balance from this transaction
.IP \[bu] 2
the account\[aq]s historical running balance after this transaction.
.PP
Transactions making a net change of zero are not shown by default; add
the \f[CR]\-E/\-\-empty\f[R] flag to show them.
.PP
For performance reasons, column widths are chosen based on the first
1000 lines; this means unusually wide values in later lines can cause
visual discontinuities as column widths are adjusted.
If you want to ensure perfect alignment, at the cost of more time and
memory, use the \f[CR]\-\-align\-all\f[R] flag.
.PP
This command also supports the output destination and output format
options.
The output formats supported are \f[CR]txt\f[R], \f[CR]csv\f[R],
\f[CR]tsv\f[R] (\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]), and \f[CR]json\f[R].
.SS aregister and posting dates
aregister always shows one line (and date and amount) per transaction.
But sometimes transactions have postings with different dates.
Also, not all of a transaction\[aq]s postings may be within the report
period.
To resolve this, aregister shows the earliest of the transaction\[aq]s
date and posting dates that is in\-period, and the sum of the in\-period
postings.
In other words it will show a combined line item with just the earliest
date, and the running balance will (temporarily, until the
transaction\[aq]s last posting) be inaccurate.
Use \f[CR]register \-H\f[R] if you need to see the individual postings.
.PP
There is also a \f[CR]\-\-txn\-dates\f[R] flag, which filters strictly
by transaction date, ignoring posting dates.
This too can cause an inaccurate running balance.

The register command displays matched postings, across all accounts, in
date order, with their running total or running historical balance.
(See also the \f[CR]aregister\f[R] command, which shows matched
transactions in a specific account.)
.PP
register normally shows line per posting, but note that multi\-commodity
amounts will occupy multiple lines (one line per commodity).
.PP
It is typically used with a query selecting a particular account, to see
that account\[aq]s activity:

For performance reasons, column widths are chosen based on the first
1000 lines; this means unusually wide values in later lines can cause
visual discontinuities as column widths are adjusted.

.PP
The \f[CR]\-\-historical\f[R]/\f[CR]\-H\f[R] flag adds the balance from
any undisplayed prior postings to the running total.
This is useful when you want to see only recent activity, with a
historically accurate running balance:

The \f[CR]\-\-depth\f[R] option limits the amount of sub\-account detail
displayed.
.PP
The \f[CR]\-\-average\f[R]/\f[CR]\-A\f[R] flag shows the running average
posting amount instead of the running total (so, the final number
displayed is the average for the whole report period).
This flag implies \f[CR]\-\-empty\f[R] (see below).
It is affected by \f[CR]\-\-historical\f[R].
It works best when showing just one account and one commodity.
.PP
The \f[CR]\-\-related\f[R]/\f[CR]\-r\f[R] flag shows the \f[I]other\f[R]
postings in the transactions of the postings which would normally be
shown.
.PP
The \f[CR]\-\-invert\f[R] flag negates all amounts.
For example, it can be used on an income account where amounts are
normally displayed as negative numbers.
It\[aq]s also useful to show postings on the checking account together
with the related account:
.PP
The \f[CR]\-\-sort=FIELDS\f[R] flag sorts by the fields given, which can
be any of \f[CR]account\f[R], \f[CR]amount\f[R], \f[CR]absamount\f[R],
\f[CR]date\f[R], or \f[CR]desc\f[R]/\f[CR]description\f[R], optionally
separated by commas.
For example, \f[CR]\-\-sort account,amount\f[R] will group all
transactions in each account, sorted by transaction amount.
Each field can be negated by a preceding \f[CR]\-\f[R], so
\f[CR]\-\-sort \-amount\f[R] will show transactions ordered from
smallest amount to largest amount.

Note when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates these

.PP
With \f[CR]\-m DESC\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-match=DESC\f[R], register does a
fuzzy search for one recent posting whose description is most similar to
DESC.
DESC should contain at least two characters.
If there is no similar\-enough match, no posting will be shown and the
program exit code will be non\-zero.
.SS Custom register output
register uses the full terminal width by default, except on windows.
You can override this by setting the \f[CR]COLUMNS\f[R] environment
variable (not a bash shell variable) or by using the
\f[CR]\-\-width\f[R]/\f[CR]\-w\f[R] option.
.PP
The description and account columns normally share the space equally
(about half of (width \- 40) each).

This command displays an income statement, showing revenues and expenses
during one or more periods.
.PP
It shows accounts declared with the \f[CR]Revenue\f[R] or
\f[CR]Expense\f[R] type (see account types).
Or if no such accounts are declared, it shows top\-level accounts named
\f[CR]revenue\f[R] or \f[CR]income\f[R] or \f[CR]expense\f[R] (case
insensitive, plurals allowed) and their subaccounts.

This command is a higher\-level variant of the \f[CR]balance\f[R]
command, and supports many of that command\[aq]s features, such as
multi\-period reports.
It is similar to
\f[CR]hledger balance \[aq](revenues|income)\[aq] expenses\f[R], but
with smarter account detection, and revenues/income displayed with their
sign flipped.
.PP
This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are \f[CR]txt\f[R], \f[CR]csv\f[R],
\f[CR]tsv\f[R] (\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]), \f[CR]html\f[R], and

\f[CR]balance\f[R] is one of hledger\[aq]s oldest and most versatile
commands, for listing account balances, balance changes, values, value
changes and more, during one time period or many.
Generally it shows a table, with rows representing accounts, and columns
representing periods.
.PP
Note there are some higher\-level variants of the \f[CR]balance\f[R]
command with convenient defaults, which can be simpler to use:
\f[CR]balancesheet\f[R], \f[CR]balancesheetequity\f[R],
\f[CR]cashflow\f[R] and \f[CR]incomestatement\f[R].
When you need more control, then use \f[CR]balance\f[R].
.SS balance features
Here\[aq]s a quick overview of the \f[CR]balance\f[R] command\[aq]s
features, followed by more detailed descriptions and examples.
Many of these work with the higher\-level commands as well.

.PP
This command supports the output destination and output format options,
with output formats \f[CR]txt\f[R], \f[CR]csv\f[R], \f[CR]tsv\f[R]
(\f[I]Added in 1.32\f[R]), \f[CR]json\f[R], and (multi\-period reports
only:) \f[CR]html\f[R], \f[CR]fods\f[R] (\f[I]Added in 1.40\f[R]).
In \f[CR]txt\f[R] output in a colour\-supporting terminal, negative
amounts are shown in red.
.SS Simple balance report
With no arguments, \f[CR]balance\f[R] shows a list of all accounts and
their change of balance \- ie, the sum of posting amounts, both inflows
and outflows \- during the entire period of the journal.
(\[dq]Simple\[dq] here means just one column of numbers, covering a
single period.
You can also have multi\-period reports, described later.)
.PP
For real\-world accounts, these numbers will normally be their end
balance at the end of the journal period; more on this below.
.PP
Accounts are sorted by declaration order if any, and then alphabetically
by account name.
For instance (using examples/sample.journal):
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal bal
                  $1  assets:bank:saving
                 $\-2  assets:cash
                  $1  expenses:food
                  $1  expenses:supplies
                 $\-1  income:gifts
                 $\-1  income:salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                   0  
.EE
.PP
Accounts with a zero balance (and no non\-zero subaccounts, in tree mode
\- see below) are hidden by default.
Use \f[CR]\-E/\-\-empty\f[R] to show them (revealing
\f[CR]assets:bank:checking\f[R] here):
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal bal  \-E
                   0  assets:bank:checking
                  $1  assets:bank:saving
                 $\-2  assets:cash
                  $1  expenses:food
                  $1  expenses:supplies
                 $\-1  income:gifts
                 $\-1  income:salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                   0  
.EE
.PP
The total of the amounts displayed is shown as the last line, unless
\f[CR]\-N\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-no\-total\f[R] is used.
.SS Balance report line format
For single\-period balance reports displayed in the terminal (only), you
can use \f[CR]\-\-format FMT\f[R] to customise the format and content of
each line.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal balance \-\-format \[dq]%20(account) %12(total)\[dq]
              assets          $\-1
         bank:saving           $1
                cash          $\-2
            expenses           $2
                food           $1
            supplies           $1
              income          $\-2
               gifts          $\-1
              salary          $\-1
   liabilities:debts           $1
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                                0
.EE
.PP
The FMT format string specifies the formatting applied to each
account/balance pair.
It may contain any suitable text, with data fields interpolated like so:
.PP
\f[CR]%[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)
.IP \[bu] 2
MAX truncates at this width (optional)
.IP \[bu] 2
FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]depth_spacer\f[R] \- a number of spaces equal to the account\[aq]s
depth, or if MIN is specified, MIN * depth spaces.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]account\f[R] \- the account\[aq]s name
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]total\f[R] \- the account\[aq]s balance/posted total, right
justified
.RE
.PP
Also, FMT can begin with an optional prefix to control how
multi\-commodity amounts are rendered:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%_\f[R] \- render on multiple lines, bottom\-aligned (the default)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%\[ha]\f[R] \- render on multiple lines, top\-aligned
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%,\f[R] \- render on one line, comma\-separated
.PP
There are some quirks.
Eg in one\-line mode, \f[CR]%(depth_spacer)\f[R] has no effect, instead
\f[CR]%(account)\f[R] has indentation built in.
\ Experimentation may be needed to get pleasing results.
.PP
Some example formats:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%(total)\f[R] \- the account\[aq]s total
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%\-20.20(account)\f[R] \- the account\[aq]s name, left justified,
padded to 20 characters and clipped at 20 characters
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%,%\-50(account)  %25(total)\f[R] \- account name padded to 50
characters, total padded to 20 characters, with multiple commodities
rendered on one line
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]%20(total)  %2(depth_spacer)%\-(account)\f[R] \- the default
format for the single\-column balance report
.SS Filtered balance report
You can show fewer accounts, a different time period, totals from
cleared transactions only, etc.
by using query arguments or options to limit the postings being matched.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal bal \-\-cleared assets date:200806
                 $\-2  assets:cash
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                 $\-2  
.EE
.SS List or tree mode
By default, or with \f[CR]\-l/\-\-flat\f[R], accounts are shown as a
flat list with their full names visible, as in the examples above.
.PP
With \f[CR]\-t/\-\-tree\f[R], the account hierarchy is shown, with
subaccounts\[aq] \[dq]leaf\[dq] names indented below their parent:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal balance
                 $\-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $\-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $\-2  income
                 $\-1    gifts
                 $\-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                   0
.EE
.PP
Notes:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[dq]Boring\[dq] accounts are combined with their subaccount for more
compact output, unless \f[CR]\-\-no\-elide\f[R] is used.
Boring accounts have no balance of their own and just one subaccount (eg
\f[CR]assets:bank\f[R] and \f[CR]liabilities\f[R] above).
.IP \[bu] 2
All balances shown are \[dq]inclusive\[dq], ie including the balances
from all subaccounts.
Note this means some repetition in the output, which requires
explanation when sharing reports with non\-plaintextaccounting\-users.
A tree mode report\[aq]s final total is the sum of the top\-level
balances shown, not of all the balances shown.
.IP \[bu] 2
Each group of sibling accounts (ie, under a common parent) is sorted
separately.
.SS Depth limiting
With a \f[CR]depth:NUM\f[R] query, or \f[CR]\-\-depth NUM\f[R] option,
or just \f[CR]\-NUM\f[R] (eg: \f[CR]\-3\f[R]) balance reports will show
accounts only to the specified depth, hiding the deeper subaccounts.
This can be useful for getting an overview without too much detail.
.PP
Account balances at the depth limit always include the balances from any
deeper subaccounts (even in list mode).
Eg, limiting to depth 1:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal balance \-1
                 $\-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $\-2  income
                  $1  liabilities
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                   0  
.EE
.SS Dropping top\-level accounts
You can also hide one or more top\-level account name parts, using
\f[CR]\-\-drop NUM\f[R].
This can be useful for hiding repetitive top\-level account names:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger \-f examples/sample.journal bal expenses \-\-drop 1
                  $1  food
                  $1  supplies
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
                  $2  
.EE
.PP
.SS Showing declared accounts
With \f[CR]\-\-declared\f[R], accounts which have been declared with an
account directive will be included in the balance report, even if they
have no transactions.
(Since they will have a zero balance, you will also need
\f[CR]\-E/\-\-empty\f[R] to see them.)
.PP
More precisely, \f[I]leaf\f[R] declared accounts (with no subaccounts)
will be included, since those are usually the more useful in reports.
.PP
The idea of this is to be able to see a useful \[dq]complete\[dq]
balance report, even when you don\[aq]t have transactions in all of your
declared accounts yet.
.SS Sorting by amount
With \f[CR]\-S/\-\-sort\-amount\f[R], accounts with the largest (most
positive) balances are shown first.
Eg: \f[CR]hledger bal expenses \-MAS\f[R] shows your biggest averaged
monthly expenses first.
When more than one commodity is present, they will be sorted by the
alphabetically earliest commodity first, and then by subsequent
commodities (if an amount is missing a commodity, it is treated as 0).
.PP
Revenues and liability balances are typically negative, however, so
\f[CR]\-S\f[R] shows these in reverse order.
To work around this, you can add \f[CR]\-\-invert\f[R] to flip the
signs.
(Or, use one of the higher\-level reports, which flip the sign
automatically.
Eg: \f[CR]hledger incomestatement \-MAS\f[R]).
.PP
.SS Percentages
With \f[CR]\-%/\-\-percent\f[R], balance reports show each account\[aq]s
value expressed as a percentage of the (column) total.
.PP
Note it is not useful to calculate percentages if the amounts in a
column have mixed signs.
In this case, make a separate report for each sign, eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger bal \-% amt:\[ga]>0\[ga]
$ hledger bal \-% amt:\[ga]<0\[ga]
.EE
.PP

.SS Balance change, end balance
It\[aq]s important to be clear on the meaning of the numbers shown in
balance reports.
Here is some terminology we use:
.PP
A \f[B]\f[BI]balance change\f[B]\f[R] is the net amount added to, or
removed from, an account during some period.
.PP
An \f[B]\f[BI]end balance\f[B]\f[R] is the amount accumulated in an
account as of some date (and some time, but hledger doesn\[aq]t store
that; assume end of day in your timezone).
It is the sum of previous balance changes.
.PP
We call it a \f[B]\f[BI]historical end balance\f[B]\f[R] if it includes
all balance changes since the account was created.
For a real world account, this means it will match the \[dq]historical
record\[dq], eg the balances reported in your bank statements or bank
web UI.
(If they are correct!)
.PP
In general, balance changes are what you want to see when reviewing
revenues and expenses, and historical end balances are what you want to
see when reviewing or reconciling asset, liability and equity accounts.
.PP
\f[CR]balance\f[R] shows balance changes by default.
To see accurate historical end balances:
.IP "1." 3
Initialise account starting balances with an \[dq]opening balances\[dq]
transaction (a transfer from equity to the account), unless the journal
covers the account\[aq]s full lifetime.
.IP "2." 3
Include all of of the account\[aq]s prior postings in the report, by not
specifying a report start date, or by using the
\f[CR]\-H/\-\-historical\f[R] flag.
(\f[CR]\-H\f[R] causes report start date to be ignored when summing
postings.)
.SS Balance report types
The balance command is quite flexible; here is the full detail on how to
control what it reports.
If the following seems complicated, don\[aq]t worry \- this is for
advanced reporting, and it does take time and experimentation to get
familiar with all the report modes.
.PP
There are three important option groups:
.PP
\f[CR]hledger balance [CALCULATIONTYPE] [ACCUMULATIONTYPE] [VALUATIONTYPE] ...\f[R]
.SS Calculation type
The basic calculation to perform for each table cell.
It is one of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-sum\f[R] : sum the posting amounts (\f[B]default\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-budget\f[R] : sum the amounts, but also show the budget goal
amount (for each account/period)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-valuechange\f[R] : show the change in period\-end historical
balance values (caused by deposits, withdrawals, and/or market price
fluctuations)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-gain\f[R] : show the unrealised capital gain/loss, (the
current valued balance minus each amount\[aq]s original cost)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-count\f[R] : show the count of postings
.SS Accumulation type
How amounts should accumulate across a report\[aq]s subperiods/columns.
Another way to say it: which time period\[aq]s postings should
contribute to each cell\[aq]s calculation.
It is one of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-change\f[R] : calculate with postings from column start to
column end, ie \[dq]just this column\[dq].
Typically used to see revenues/expenses.
(\f[B]default for balance, cashflow, incomestatement\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-cumulative\f[R] : calculate with postings from report start to
column end, ie \[dq]previous columns plus this column\[dq].
Typically used to show changes accumulated since the report\[aq]s start
date.
Not often used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-historical/\-H\f[R] : calculate with postings from journal
start to column end, ie \[dq]all postings from before report start date
until this column\[aq]s end\[dq].
Typically used to see historical end balances of
assets/liabilities/equity.
(\f[B]default for balancesheet, balancesheetequity\f[R])
.SS Valuation type
Which kind of value or cost conversion should be applied, if any, before
displaying the report.
It is one of:
.IP \[bu] 2
no valuation type : don\[aq]t convert to cost or value
(\f[B]default\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-value=cost[,COMM]\f[R] : convert amounts to cost (then
optionally to some other commodity)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-value=then[,COMM]\f[R] : convert amounts to market value on
transaction dates
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-value=end[,COMM]\f[R] : convert amounts to market value on
period end date(s)
.PD 0
.P
.PD
(\f[B]default with \f[CB]\-\-valuechange\f[B], \f[CB]\-\-gain\f[B]\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-value=now[,COMM]\f[R] : convert amounts to market value on
today\[aq]s date
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-value=YYYY\-MM\-DD[,COMM]\f[R] : convert amounts to market
value on another date
.PP
or one of the equivalent simpler flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-B/\-\-cost\f[R] : like \-\-value=cost (though, note \-\-cost and
\-\-value are independent options which can both be used at once)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-V/\-\-market\f[R] : like \-\-value=end
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-X COMM/\-\-exchange COMM\f[R] : like \-\-value=end,COMM
.PP
See Cost reporting and Value reporting for more about these.
.SS Combining balance report types
Most combinations of these options should produce reasonable reports,
but if you find any that seem wrong or misleading, let us know.
The following restrictions are applied:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-valuechange\f[R] implies \f[CR]\-\-value=end\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-valuechange\f[R] makes \f[CR]\-\-change\f[R] the default when
used with the \f[CR]balancesheet\f[R]/\f[CR]balancesheetequity\f[R]
commands
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-cumulative\f[R] or \f[CR]\-\-historical\f[R] disables
\f[CR]\-\-row\-total/\-T\f[R]
.PP
For reference, here is what the combinations of accumulation and
valuation show:

.SS Budget report
The \f[CR]\-\-budget\f[R] report type is like a regular balance report,
but with two main differences:
.IP \[bu] 2
Budget goals and performance percentages are also shown, in brackets
.IP \[bu] 2
Accounts which don\[aq]t have budget goals are hidden by default.
.PP
This is useful for comparing planned and actual income, expenses, time
usage, etc.
.PP
Periodic transaction rules are used to define budget goals.
For example, here\[aq]s a periodic rule defining monthly goals for bus
travel and food expenses:
.IP
.EX
;; Budget
\[ti] monthly
  (expenses:bus)              $30
  (expenses:food)            $400
.EE
.PP
After recording some actual expenses,
.IP

This is \[dq]goal\-based budgeting\[dq]; you define goals for accounts
and periods, often recurring, and hledger shows performance relative to
the goals.
This contrasts with \[dq]envelope budgeting\[dq], which is more detailed
and strict \- useful when cash is tight, but also quite a bit more work.
https://plaintextaccounting.org/Budgeting has more on this topic.
.SS Using the budget report
Historically this report has been confusing and fragile.
hledger\[aq]s version should be relatively robust and intuitive, but you
may still find surprises.
Here are more notes to help with learning and troubleshooting.
.IP \[bu] 2
In the above example, \f[CR]expenses:bus\f[R] and
\f[CR]expenses:food\f[R] are shown because they have budget goals during
the report period.
.IP \[bu] 2
Their parent \f[CR]expenses\f[R] is also shown, with budget goals
aggregated from the children.
.IP \[bu] 2
The subaccounts \f[CR]expenses:food:groceries\f[R] and
\f[CR]expenses:food:dining\f[R] are not shown since they have no budget
goal of their own, but they contribute to \f[CR]expenses:food\f[R]\[aq]s
actual amount.
.IP \[bu] 2
Unbudgeted accounts \f[CR]expenses:movies\f[R] and
\f[CR]expenses:gifts\f[R] are also not shown, but they contribute to
\f[CR]expenses\f[R]\[aq]s actual amount.
.IP \[bu] 2
The other unbudgeted accounts \f[CR]income\f[R] and
\f[CR]assets:bank:checking\f[R] are grouped as \f[CR]<unbudgeted>\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-depth\f[R] or \f[CR]depth:\f[R] can be used to limit report
depth in the usual way (but will not reveal unbudgeted subaccounts).
.IP \[bu] 2
Amounts are always inclusive of subaccounts (even in
\f[CR]\-l/\-\-list\f[R] mode).
.IP \[bu] 2
Numbers displayed in a \-\-budget report will not always agree with the
totals, because of hidden unbudgeted accounts; this is normal.
\f[CR]\-E/\-\-empty\f[R] can be used to reveal the hidden accounts.
.IP \[bu] 2
In the periodic rules used for setting budget goals, unbalanced postings
are convenient.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can filter budget reports with the usual queries, eg to focus on
particular accounts.
It\[aq]s common to restrict them to just expenses.
(The \f[CR]<unbudgeted>\f[R] account is occasionally hard to exclude;
this is because of date surprises, discussed below.)
.IP \[bu] 2
When you have multiple currencies, you may want to convert them to one
(\f[CR]\-X COMM \-\-infer\-market\-prices\f[R]) and/or show just one at
a time (\f[CR]cur:COMM\f[R]).
If you do need to show multiple currencies at once,
\f[CR]\-\-layout bare\f[R] can be helpful.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can \[dq]roll over\[dq] amounts (actual and budgeted) to the next
period with \f[CR]\-\-cumulative\f[R].
.PP
See also: https://hledger.org/budgeting.html.
.SS Budget date surprises
With small data, or when starting out, some of the generated budget goal
transaction dates might fall outside the report periods.
Eg with the following journal and report, the first period appears to
have no \f[CR]expenses:food\f[R] budget.
(Also the \f[CR]<unbudgeted>\f[R] account should be excluded by the
\f[CR]expenses\f[R] query, but isn\[aq]t.):
.IP
.EX
\[ti] monthly in 2020
  (expenses:food)  $500

2020\-01\-15
  expenses:food    $400
  assets:checking
.EE
.IP
.EX
$ hledger bal \-\-budget expenses
Budget performance in 2020\-01\-15:

               ||         2020\-01\-15

 <unbudgeted>  || $400               
 expenses:food ||    0 [ 0% of $500] 
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-++\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
               || $400 [80% of $500] 
.EE
.PP
In this case, the budget goal transactions are generated on first days
of of month (this can be seen with
\f[CR]hledger print \-\-forecast tag:generated expenses\f[R]).
Whereas the report period defaults to just the 15th day of january (this
can be seen from the report table\[aq]s column headings).
.PP
To fix this kind of thing, be more explicit about the report period
(and/or the periodic rules\[aq] dates).
In this case, adding \f[CR]\-b 2020\f[R] does the trick.
.SS Selecting budget goals
By default, the budget report uses all available periodic transaction
rules to generate goals.
This includes rules with a different report interval from your report.
Eg if you have daily, weekly and monthly periodic rules, all of these
will contribute to the goals in a monthly budget report.
.PP
You can select a subset of periodic rules by providing an argument to
the \f[CR]\-\-budget\f[R] flag.
\f[CR]\-\-budget=DESCPAT\f[R] will match all periodic rules whose
description contains DESCPAT, a case\-insensitive substring (not a
regular expression or query).
This means you can give your periodic rules descriptions (remember that
two spaces are needed between period expression and description), and
then select from multiple budgets defined in your journal.
.SS Budgeting vs forecasting
\f[CR]\-\-forecast\f[R] and \f[CR]\-\-budget\f[R] both use the periodic
transaction rules in the journal to generate temporary transactions for
reporting purposes.
However they are separate features \- though you can use both at the
same time if you want.
Here are some differences between them:

.SS Balance report layout
The \f[CR]\-\-layout\f[R] option affects how \f[CR]balance\f[R] and the
other balance\-like commands show multi\-commodity amounts and commodity
symbols.
It can improve readability, for humans and/or machines (other software).
It has four possible values:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-layout=wide[,WIDTH]\f[R]: commodities are shown on a single
line, optionally elided to WIDTH
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-layout=tall\f[R]: each commodity is shown on a separate line
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-layout=bare\f[R]: commodity symbols are in their own column,
amounts are bare numbers
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-layout=tidy\f[R]: data is normalised to easily\-consumed
\[dq]tidy\[dq] form, with one row per data value.
(This one is currently supported only by the \f[CR]balance\f[R]
command.)

.SS IRR and TWR explained
\[dq]ROI\[dq] stands for \[dq]return on investment\[dq].
Traditionally this was computed as a difference between current value of
investment and its initial value, expressed in percentage of the initial
value.
.PP
However, this approach is only practical in simple cases, where
investments receives no in\-flows or out\-flows of money, and where rate
of growth is fixed over time.
For more complex scenarios you need different ways to compute rate of
return, and this command implements two of them: IRR and TWR.
.PP
Internal rate of return, or \[dq]IRR\[dq] (also called
\[dq]money\-weighted rate of return\[dq]) takes into account effects of
in\-flows and out\-flows, and the time between them.
Investment at a particular fixed interest rate is going to give you more
interest than the same amount invested at the same interest rate, but
made later in time.
If you are withdrawing from your investment, your future gains would be
smaller (in absolute numbers), and will be a smaller percentage of your
initial investment, so your IRR will be smaller.
And if you are adding to your investment, you will receive bigger
absolute gains, which will be a bigger percentage of your initial
investment, so your IRR will be larger.
.PP
As mentioned before, in\-flows and out\-flows would be any cash that you
personally put in or withdraw, and for the \[dq]roi\[dq] command, these
are the postings that match the query in the\f[CR]\-\-inv\f[R] argument
and NOT match the query in the\f[CR]\-\-pnl\f[R] argument.
.PP
If you manually record changes in the value of your investment as
transactions that balance them against \[dq]profit and loss\[dq] (or
\[dq]unrealized gains\[dq]) account or use price directives, then in
order for IRR to compute the precise effect of your in\-flows and
out\-flows on the rate of return, you will need to record the value of
your investement on or close to the days when in\- or out\-flows occur.
.PP
In technical terms, IRR uses the same approach as computation of net
present value, and tries to find a discount rate that makes net present
value of all the cash flows of your investment to add up to zero.
This could be hard to wrap your head around, especially if you
haven\[aq]t done discounted cash flow analysis before.
Implementation of IRR in hledger should produce results that match the
\f[CR]=XIRR\f[R] formula in Excel.
.PP
Second way to compute rate of return that \f[CR]roi\f[R] command
implements is called \[dq]time\-weighted rate of return\[dq] or
\[dq]TWR\[dq].
Like IRR, it will account for the effect of your in\-flows and
out\-flows, but unlike IRR it will try to compute the true rate of
return of the underlying asset, compensating for the effect that
deposits and withdrawas have on the apparent rate of growth of your

TWR represents your investment as an imaginary \[dq]unit fund\[dq] where
in\-flows/ out\-flows lead to buying or selling \[dq]units\[dq] of your
investment and changes in its value change the value of \[dq]investment
unit\[dq].
Change in \[dq]unit price\[dq] over the reporting period gives you rate
of return of your investment, and make TWR less sensitive than IRR to
the effects of cash in\-flows and out\-flows.

\f[CR]close\f[R] generates several kinds of \[dq]closing\[dq] and/or
\[dq]opening\[dq] transactions, useful in certain situations, including
migrating balances to a new journal file, retaining earnings into
equity, consolidating balances, or viewing lots.
Like \f[CR]print\f[R], it prints valid journal entries.
You can append or copy these to your journal file(s) when you are happy
with how they look.

.PP
\f[CR]close\f[R] currently has six modes, selected by a single mode
flag:
.SS close \-\-migrate
This is the most common mode.
It prints a \[dq]closing balances\[dq] transaction that zeroes out all
asset and liability balances (by default), and an opposite \[dq]opening
balances\[dq] transaction that restores them again.
The balancing account will be \f[CR]equity:opening/closing balances\f[R]
(or another specified by \f[CR]\-\-close\-acct\f[R] or
\f[CR]\-\-open\-acct\f[R]).
.PP
This is useful when migrating balances to a new journal file at the
start of a new year.
Essentially, you run
\f[CR]hledger close \-\-migrate=NEWYEAR \-e NEWYEAR\f[R] and then copy
the closing transaction to the end of the old file and the opening
transaction to the start of the new file.
The opening transaction sets correct starting balances in the new file
when it is used alone, and the closing transaction keeps balances
correct when you use both old and new files together, by cancelling out
the following opening transaction and preventing buildup of duplicated
opening balances.
Think of the closing/opening pair as \[dq]moving the balances into the
next file\[dq].
.PP
You can close a different set of accounts by providing a query.
Eg if you want to include equity, you can add
\f[CR]assets liabilities equity\f[R] or \f[CR]type:ALE\f[R] arguments.
(The balancing account is always excluded.)
Revenues and expenses usually are not migrated to a new file directly;
see \f[CR]\-\-retain\f[R] below.
.PP
The generated transactions will have a \f[CR]start:\f[R] tag, with its
value set to \f[CR]\-\-migrate\f[R]\[aq]s \f[CR]NEW\f[R] argument if
any, for easier matching or exclusion.
When \f[CR]NEW\f[R] is not specified, it will be inferred if possible by
incrementing a number (eg a year number) within the default
journal\[aq]s main file name.
The other modes behave similarly.
.SS close \-\-close
This prints just the closing balances transaction of
\f[CR]\-\-migrate\f[R].
It is the default behaviour if you specify no mode flag.
Using the customisation options below, you can move balances from any
set of accounts to a different account.
.SS close \-\-open
This prints just the opening balances transaction of
\f[CR]\-\-migrate\f[R].
It is similar to Ledger\[aq]s equity command.
.SS close \-\-assert
This prints a \[dq]closing balances\[dq] transaction (with
\f[CR]balances:\f[R] tag), that just declares balance assertions for the
current balances without changing them.
It could be useful as documention and to guard against changes.
.SS close \-\-assign
This prints an \[dq]opening balances\[dq] transaction that restores the
account balances using balance assignments.
Balance assignments work regardless of any previous balance, so a
preceding closing balances transaction is not needed.
.PP
However, omitting the closing balances transaction would unbalance
equity.
This is relatively harmless for personal reports, but it disturbs the
accounting equation, removing a source of error detection.
So \f[CR]\-\-migrate\f[R] is generally the best way to set to set
balances in new files, for now.
.SS close \-\-retain
This is like \f[CR]\-\-close\f[R] with different defaults: it prints a
\[dq]retain earnings\[dq] transaction (with \f[CR]retain:\f[R] tag),
that transfers revenue and expense balances to
\f[CR]equity:retained earnings\f[R].
.PP
This is a different kind of closing, called \[dq]retaining earnings\[dq]
or \[dq]closing the books\[dq]; it is traditionally performed by
businesses at the end of each accounting period, to consolidate revenues
and expenses into the main equity balance.
(\[dq]Revenues\[dq] and \[dq]expenses\[dq] are actually equity by
another name, kept separate temporarily for reporting purposes.)
.PP
In personal accounting you generally don\[aq]t need to do this, unless
you want the \f[CR]balancesheetequity\f[R] report to show a zero total,
demonstrating that the accounting equation (A\-L=E) is satisfied.
.SS close customisation
In all modes, the following things can be overridden:
.IP \[bu] 2
the accounts to be closed/opened, with account query arguments
.IP \[bu] 2
the balancing account, with \f[CR]\-\-close\-acct=ACCT\f[R] and/or
\f[CR]\-\-open\-acct=ACCT\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
the transaction descriptions, with \f[CR]\-\-close\-desc=DESC\f[R] and
\f[CR]\-\-open\-desc=DESC\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
the transaction\[aq]s tag value, with a \f[CR]\-\-MODE=NEW\f[R] option
argument
.IP \[bu] 2
the closing/opening dates, with \f[CR]\-e OPENDATE\f[R]
.PP
By default, the closing date is yesterday, or the journal\[aq]s end
date, whichever is later; and the opening date is always one day after
the closing date.
You can change these by specifying a report end date; the closing date
will be the last day of the report period.
Eg \f[CR]\-e 2024\f[R] means \[dq]close on 2023\-12\-31, open on
2024\-01\-01\[dq].
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-x/\-\-explicit\f[R], the balancing amount will be shown
explicitly, and if it involves multiple commodities, a separate posting
will be generated for each of them (similar to \f[CR]print \-x\f[R]).
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-interleaved\f[R], each individual transfer is shown with
source and destination postings next to each other (perhaps useful for
troubleshooting).
.PP
With \f[CR]\-\-show\-costs\f[R], balances\[aq] costs are also shown,
with different costs kept separate.
This may generate very large journal entries, if you have many currency
conversions or investment transactions.
\f[CR]close \-\-show\-costs\f[R] is currently the best way to view
investment lots with hledger.
(To move or dispose of lots, see the more capable
\f[CR]hledger\-move\f[R] script.)
.SS close and balance assertions
\f[CR]close\f[R] adds balance assertions verifying that the accounts
have been reset to zero in a closing transaction or restored to their
previous balances in an opening transaction.
These provide useful error checking, but you can ignore them temporarily
with \f[CR]\-I\f[R], or remove them if you prefer.
.PP
Single\-commodity, subaccount\-exclusive balance assertions
(\f[CR]=\f[R]) are generated by default.
This can be changed with \f[CR]\-\-assertion\-type=\[aq]==*\[aq]\f[R]
(eg).
.PP
When running \f[CR]close\f[R] you should probably avoid using
\f[CR]\-C\f[R], \f[CR]\-R\f[R], \f[CR]status:\f[R] (filtering by status
or realness) or \f[CR]\-\-auto\f[R] (generating postings), since the
generated balance assertions would then require these.
.PP
Transactions with multiple dates (eg posting dates) spanning the file
boundary also can disrupt the balance assertions:
.IP
.EX
2023\-12\-30 a purchase made in december, cleared in january
    expenses:food          5
    assets:bank:checking  \-5  ; date: 2023\-01\-02
.EE
.PP
To solve this you can transfer the money to and from a temporary
account, splitting the multi\-day transaction into two single\-day
transactions:
.IP
.EX
; in 2022.journal:
2022\-12\-30 a purchase made in december, cleared in january

.SS rewrite vs. print \-\-auto
This command predates print \-\-auto, and currently does much the same
thing, but with these differences:
.IP \[bu] 2
with multiple files, rewrite lets rules in any file affect all other
files.
print \-\-auto uses standard directive scoping; rules affect only child
files.
.IP \[bu] 2
rewrite\[aq]s query limits which transactions can be rewritten; all are
printed.
print \-\-auto\[aq]s query limits which transactions are printed.
.IP \[bu] 2
rewrite applies rules specified on command line or in the journal.
print \-\-auto applies rules specified in the journal.
.SH Maintenance commands
.SS check
Check for various kinds of errors in your data.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
no command\-specific flags
.EE
.PP
hledger provides a number of built\-in correctness checks to help
validate your data and prevent errors.
Some are run automatically, some when you enable \f[CR]\-\-strict\f[R]
mode; or you can run any of them on demand by providing them as
arguments to the \f[CR]check\f[R] command.
\f[CR]check\f[R] produces no output and a zero exit code if all is well.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
hledger check                      # run basic checks
hledger check \-s                   # run basic and strict checks
hledger check ordereddates payees  # run basic checks and two others
.EE
.PP
If you are an Emacs user, you can also configure flycheck\-hledger to
run these checks, providing instant feedback as you edit the journal.
.PP
Here are the checks currently available.
Generally, they are performed in the order they are shown here (and only
the first failure is reported).
.SS Basic checks
These important checks are performed by default, by almost all hledger
commands:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]parseable\f[R] \- data files are in a supported format, with no
syntax errors and no invalid include directives.
This ensures that all files exist and are readable.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]autobalanced\f[R] \- all transactions are balanced, after inferring
missing amounts and conversion costs where possible, and then converting
to cost.
This ensures that each individual transaction is well formed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]assertions\f[R] \- all balance assertions in the journal are
passing.
Balance assertions are like canaries in your journal, they catch many
problems.
They can get in the way sometimes; you can disable them temporarily with
\f[CR]\-I\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-ignore\-assertions\f[R] (unless overridden with
\f[CR]\-s\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-strict\f[R] or
\f[CR]hledger check assertions\f[R]).
.SS Strict checks
These additional checks are performed by any command when the
\f[CR]\-s\f[R]/\f[CR]\-\-strict\f[R] flag is used (strict mode).
Strict mode always enables the balance assertions check, also.
These provide extra error\-catching power when you are serious about
keeping your data clean and free of typos:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]balanced\f[R] \- like \f[CR]autobalanced\f[R], but in conversion
transactions, costs must be written explicitly.
This ensures some redundancy in the entry, which helps prevent typos.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]commodities\f[R] \- all commodity symbols used must be declared.
This guards against mistyping or omitting commodity symbols.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]accounts\f[R] \- all account names used must be declared.
This prevents the use of mis\-spelled or outdated account names.
.SS Other checks
These other checks are not wanted by everyone, but can be run using the
\f[CR]check\f[R] command:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ordereddates\f[R] \- within each file, transactions are ordered by
date.
This is a simple and effective error catcher, and you should use it.
Alas!
not everyone wants it.
If you do, use \f[CR]hledger check \-s ordereddates\f[R].
When enabled, this check is performed early, before balance assertions
(because copy\-pasted dates are often the root cause of balance
assertion failures).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]payees\f[R] \- all payees used by transactions must be declared.
This will force you to always use known/declared payee names.
For most people this is a bit too restrictive.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]tags\f[R] \- all tags used by transactions must be declared.
This prevents mistyped tag names.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]recentassertions\f[R] \- all accounts with balance assertions must
have a balance assertion within the last 7 days before their latest
posting.
This encourages you to add balance assertions fairly regularly for your
active asset/liability accounts, which in turn should encourage you to
check and reconcile with their real world balances fairly regularly.
\f[CR]close \-\-assert\f[R] can be helpful.
(The older balance assertions become redundant; you can remove them
periodically, or leave them in place, perhaps commented, as
documentation.)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]uniqueleafnames\f[R] \- no two accounts may have the same leaf
name.
The leaf name is the last colon\-separated part of an account name, eg
\f[CR]checking\f[R] in \f[CR]assets:bank:checking\f[R].
This encourages you to keep those unique, effectively giving each
account a short name which is easier to remember and to type in
reporting commands.
.SS Custom checks
You can build your own custom checks with add\-on command scripts.
See also Cookbook > Scripting.
Here are some examples from hledger/bin/:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]hledger\-check\-tagfiles\f[R] \- all tag values containing / (a
forward slash) exist as file paths
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]hledger\-check\-fancyassertions\f[R] \- more complex balance
assertions are passing
.SS diff
Compares a particular account\[aq]s transactions in two input files.
It shows any transactions to this account which are in one file but not
in the other.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
no command\-specific flags
.EE
.PP
More precisely: for each posting affecting this account in either file,
this command looks for a corresponding posting in the other file which
posts the same amount to the same account (ignoring date, description,
etc).
.PP
Since it compares postings, not transactions, this also works when
multiple bank transactions have been combined into a single journal
entry.
.PP
This command is useful eg if you have downloaded an account\[aq]s
transactions from your bank (eg as CSV data): when hledger and your bank
disagree about the account balance, you can compare the bank data with
your journal to find out the cause.
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger diff \-f $LEDGER_FILE \-f bank.csv assets:bank:giro 
These transactions are in the first file only:

2014/01/01 Opening Balances
    assets:bank:giro              EUR ...
    ...
    equity:opening balances       EUR \-...

These transactions are in the second file only:
.EE
.SS test
Run built\-in unit tests.
.IP
.EX
Flags:
no command\-specific flags
.EE
.PP
This command runs the unit tests built in to hledger and hledger\-lib,
printing the results on stdout.
If any test fails, the exit code will be non\-zero.
.PP
This is mainly used by hledger developers, but you can also use it to
sanity\-check the installed hledger executable on your platform.
All tests are expected to pass \- if you ever see a failure, please
report as a bug!
.PP
This command also accepts tasty test runner options, written after a
\-\- (double hyphen).
Eg to run only the tests in Hledger.Data.Amount, with ANSI colour codes
disabled:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger test \-\- \-pData.Amount \-\-color=never
.EE
.PP

.SH PART 5: COMMON TASKS
Here are some quick examples of how to do some basic tasks with hledger.
.SH Getting help
Here\[aq]s how to list commands and view options and command docs:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger                # show available commands
$ hledger \-\-help         # show common options
$ hledger CMD \-\-help     # show CMD\[aq]s options, common options and CMD\[aq]s documentation
.EE
.PP
You can also view your hledger version\[aq]s manual in several formats
by using the help command.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger help           # show the hledger manual with info, man or $PAGER (best available)
$ hledger help journal   # show the journal topic in the hledger manual
$ hledger help \-\-help    # find out more about the help command
.EE
.PP
To view manuals and introductory docs on the web, visit
https://hledger.org.
Chat and mail list support and discussion archives can be found at
https://hledger.org/support.
.SH Constructing command lines
hledger has a flexible command line interface.
We strive to keep it simple and ergonomic, but if you run into one of
the sharp edges described in OPTIONS, here are some tips that might
help:
.IP \[bu] 2
command\-specific options must go after the command (it\[aq]s fine to
put common options there too: \f[CR]hledger CMD OPTS ARGS\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
running add\-on executables directly simplifies command line parsing
(\f[CR]hledger\-ui OPTS ARGS\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
enclose \[dq]problematic\[dq] args in single quotes
.IP \[bu] 2
if needed, also add a backslash to hide regular expression
metacharacters from the shell
.IP \[bu] 2
to see how a misbehaving command line is being parsed, add
\f[CR]\-\-debug=2\f[R].
.SH Starting a journal file
hledger looks for your accounting data in a journal file,
\f[CR]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[R] by default:
.IP
.EX
$ hledger stats
The hledger journal file \[dq]/Users/simon/.hledger.journal\[dq] was not found.
Please create it first, eg with \[dq]hledger add\[dq] or a text editor.
Or, specify an existing journal file with \-f or LEDGER_FILE.
.EE
.PP
You can override this by setting the \f[CR]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] environment
variable (see below).
It\[aq]s a good practice to keep this important file under version
control, and to start a new file each year.
So you could do something like this:
.IP
.EX
$ mkdir \[ti]/finance
$ cd \[ti]/finance
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/simon/finance/.git/
$ touch 2023.journal
$ echo \[dq]export LEDGER_FILE=$HOME/finance/2023.journal\[dq] >> \[ti]/.profile
$ source \[ti]/.profile
$ hledger stats
Main file                : /Users/simon/finance/2023.journal
Included files           : 
Transactions span        :  to  (0 days)
Last transaction         : none
Transactions             : 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions      : 0
Accounts                 : 0 (depth 0)
Commodities              : 0 ()
Market prices            : 0 ()
.EE
.SH Setting LEDGER_FILE
How to set \f[CR]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] permanently depends on your setup:
.PP
On unix and mac, running these commands in the terminal will work for
many people; adapt as needed:
.IP
.EX
$ echo \[aq]export LEDGER_FILE=\[ti]/finance/2023.journal\[aq] >> \[ti]/.profile
$ source \[ti]/.profile
.EE
.PP
When correctly configured, in a new terminal window
\f[CR]env | grep LEDGER_FILE\f[R] will show your file, and so will
\f[CR]hledger files\f[R].
.PP
On mac, this additional step might be helpful for GUI applications (like
Emacs started from the dock): add an entry to
\f[CR]\[ti]/.MacOSX/environment.plist\f[R] like
.IP
.EX
{
  \[dq]LEDGER_FILE\[dq] : \[dq]\[ti]/finance/2023.journal\[dq]
}
.EE
.PP
and then run \f[CR]killall Dock\f[R] in a terminal window (or restart
the machine).
.PP
On Windows, see https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html, or try
running these commands in a powershell window (let us know if it
persists across a reboot, and if you need to be an Administrator):
.IP
.EX
> CD
> MKDIR finance
> SETX LEDGER_FILE \[dq]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]USERNAME\[rs]finance\[rs]2023.journal\[dq]
.EE
.SH Setting opening balances
Pick a starting date for which you can look up the balances of some
real\-world assets (bank accounts, wallet..)
and liabilities (credit cards..).
.PP
To avoid a lot of data entry, you may want to start with just one or two
accounts, like your checking account or cash wallet; and pick a recent
starting date, like today or the start of the week.
You can always come back later and add more accounts and older
transactions, eg going back to january 1st.
.PP
Add an opening balances transaction to the journal, declaring the
balances on this date.
Here are two ways to do it:
.IP \[bu] 2
The first way: open the journal in any text editor and save an entry
like this:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-01 * opening balances
    assets:bank:checking                $1000   = $1000
    assets:bank:savings                 $2000   = $2000
    assets:cash                          $100   = $100
    liabilities:creditcard               $\-50   = $\-50
    equity:opening/closing balances
.EE
.PP
These are start\-of\-day balances, ie whatever was in the account at the
end of the previous day.
.PP
The * after the date is an optional status flag.
Here it means \[dq]cleared & confirmed\[dq].
.PP
The currency symbols are optional, but usually a good idea as you\[aq]ll
be dealing with multiple currencies sooner or later.
.PP
The = amounts are optional balance assertions, providing extra error
checking.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
The second way: run \f[CR]hledger add\f[R] and follow the prompts to
record a similar transaction:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
$ hledger add
Adding transactions to journal file /Users/simon/finance/2023.journal
Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to go one step backward.
To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control\-d or control\-c.
Date [2023\-02\-07]: 2023\-01\-01
Description: * opening balances

Account 4: liabilities:creditcard
Amount  4 [$\-3100]: $\-50
Account 5: equity:opening/closing balances
Amount  5 [$\-3050]: 
Account 6 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
2023\-01\-01 * opening balances
    assets:bank:checking                      $1000
    assets:bank:savings                       $2000
    assets:cash                                $100
    liabilities:creditcard                     $\-50

.PP
If you\[aq]re using version control, this could be a good time to commit
the journal.
Eg:
.IP
.EX
$ git commit \-m \[aq]initial balances\[aq] 2023.journal
.EE
.SH Recording transactions
As you spend or receive money, you can record these transactions using
one of the methods above (text editor, hledger add) or by using the
hledger\-iadd or hledger\-web add\-ons, or by using the import command
to convert CSV data downloaded from your bank.
.PP
Here are some simple transactions, see the hledger_journal(5) manual and
hledger.org for more ideas:
.IP
.EX
2023/1/10 * gift received
  assets:cash   $20
  income:gifts

2023.1.12 * farmers market
  expenses:food    $13
  assets:cash

2023\-01\-15 paycheck
  income:salary
  assets:bank:checking    $1000
.EE
.SH Reconciling
Periodically you should reconcile \- compare your hledger\-reported
balances against external sources of truth, like bank statements or your
bank\[aq]s website \- to be sure that your ledger accurately represents
the real\-world balances (and, that the real\-world institutions have
not made a mistake!).
This gets easy and fast with (1) practice and (2) frequency.
If you do it daily, it can take 2\-10 minutes.
If you let it pile up, expect it to take longer as you hunt down errors
and discrepancies.
.PP
A typical workflow:
.IP "1." 3
Reconcile cash.
Count what\[aq]s in your wallet.
Compare with what hledger reports (\f[CR]hledger bal cash\f[R]).
If they are different, try to remember the missing transaction, or look
for the error in the already\-recorded transactions.
A register report can be helpful (\f[CR]hledger reg cash\f[R]).
If you can\[aq]t find the error, add an adjustment transaction.
Eg if you have $105 after the above, and can\[aq]t explain the missing
$2, it could be:
.RS 4
.IP
.EX
2023\-01\-16 * adjust cash
    assets:cash    $\-2 = $105
    expenses:misc
.EE
.RE
.IP "2." 3
Reconcile checking.
Log in to your bank\[aq]s website.
Compare today\[aq]s (cleared) balance with hledger\[aq]s cleared balance
(\f[CR]hledger bal checking \-C\f[R]).
If they are different, track down the error or record the missing
transaction(s) or add an adjustment transaction, similar to the above.
Unlike the cash case, you can usually compare the transaction history
and running balance from your bank with the one reported by
\f[CR]hledger reg checking \-C\f[R].
This will be easier if you generally record transaction dates quite
similar to your bank\[aq]s clearing dates.
.IP "3." 3
Repeat for other asset/liability accounts.
.PP
Tip: instead of the register command, use hledger\-ui to see a
live\-updating register while you edit the journal:
\f[CR]hledger\-ui \-\-watch \-\-register checking \-C\f[R]
.PP
After reconciling, it could be a good time to mark the reconciled
transactions\[aq] status as \[dq]cleared and confirmed\[dq], if you want
to track that, by adding the \f[CR]*\f[R] marker.
Eg in the paycheck transaction above, insert \f[CR]*\f[R] between
\f[CR]2023\-01\-15\f[R] and \f[CR]paycheck\f[R]
.PP
If you\[aq]re using version control, this can be another good time to
commit:

.SH Migrating to a new file
At the end of the year, you may want to continue your journal in a new

See the close command.
.PP
If using version control, don\[aq]t forget to \f[CR]git add\f[R] the new

.SH BUGS
We welcome bug reports in the hledger issue tracker (shortcut:
http://bugs.hledger.org), or on the #hledger chat or hledger mail list
(https://hledger.org/support).
.PP
Some known issues and limitations:
.PP
The need to precede add\-on command options with \f[CR]\-\-\f[R] when
invoked from hledger is awkward.
(See Command options, Constructing command lines.)
.PP
A UTF\-8\-aware system locale must be configured to work with non\-ascii
data.
(See Unicode characters, Troubleshooting.)
.PP
On Microsoft Windows, depending whether you are running in a CMD window
or a Cygwin/MSYS/Mintty window and how you installed hledger, non\-ascii
characters and colours may not be supported, and the tab key may not be
supported by \f[CR]hledger add\f[R].
(Running in a WSL window should resolve these.)
.PP
When processing large data files, hledger uses more memory than Ledger.
.SS Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues you might encounter when you run hledger,
and how to resolve them (and remember also you can usually get quick
Support):
.PP
\f[B]PATH issues: I get an error like \[dq]No command \[aq]hledger\[aq]
found\[dq]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Depending how you installed hledger, the executables may not be in your
shell\[aq]s PATH.
Eg on unix systems, stack installs hledger in
\f[CR]\[ti]/.local/bin\f[R] and cabal installs it in
\f[CR]\[ti]/.cabal/bin\f[R].
You may need to add one of these directories to your shell\[aq]s PATH,
and/or open a new terminal window.
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE issues: I configured LEDGER_FILE but hledger is not
using it\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] should be a real environment variable, not just a
shell variable.
Eg on unix, the command \f[CR]env | grep LEDGER_FILE\f[R] should show
it.
You may need to use \f[CR]export\f[R] (see
https://stackoverflow.com/a/7411509).
.IP \[bu] 2
You may need to force your shell to see the new configuration.
A simple way is to close your terminal window and open a new one.
.PP
\f[B]LANG issues: I get errors like \[dq]Illegal byte sequence\[dq] or
\[dq]Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character\[dq] or
\[dq]commitAndReleaseBuffer: invalid argument (invalid
character)\[dq]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Programs compiled with GHC (hledger, haskell build tools, etc.)
need the system locale to be UTF\-8\-aware, or they will fail when they
encounter non\-ascii characters.
To fix it, set the LANG environment variable to a locale which supports
UTF\-8 and which is installed on your system.

On unix, \f[CR]locale \-a\f[R] lists the installed locales.
Look for one which mentions \f[CR]utf8\f[R], \f[CR]UTF\-8\f[R] or
similar.
Some examples: \f[CR]C.UTF\-8\f[R], \f[CR]en_US.utf\-8\f[R],
\f[CR]fr_FR.utf8\f[R].
If necessary, use your system package manager to install one.
Then select it by setting the \f[CR]LANG\f[R] environment variable.
Note, exact spelling and capitalisation of the locale name may be
important: Here\[aq]s one common way to configure this permanently for
your shell:
.IP
.EX
$ echo \[dq]export LANG=en_US.utf8\[dq] >>\[ti]/.profile
# close and re\-open terminal window
.EE
.PP
If you are using Nix (not NixOS) for GHC and Hledger, you might need to
set the \f[CR]LOCALE_ARCHIVE\f[R] variable:
.IP
.EX
$ echo \[dq]export LOCALE_ARCHIVE=${glibcLocales}/lib/locale/locale\-archive\[dq] >>\[ti]/.profile
# close and re\-open terminal window
.EE
