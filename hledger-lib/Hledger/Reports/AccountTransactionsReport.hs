-- | An account transactions report represents transactions affecting
-- a particular account (or possibly several accounts, but we don't
-- use that). It is used eg by hledger-ui's and hledger-web's register
-- view, and hledger's aregister report, where we want to show one row
-- per transaction, in the context of the current account. Report
-- items consist of:
--
-- - the transaction, unmodified
--
-- - the transaction as seen in the context of the current account and query,
--   which means:
--
--   - the transaction date is set to the "transaction context date":
--     the earliest of the transaction date and any other posting dates
--     of postings to the current account (matched by the report query).
--
--   - the transaction's postings are filtered, excluding any which are not
--     matched by the report query
--
-- - a text description of the other account(s) posted to/from
--
-- - a flag indicating whether there's more than one other account involved
--
-- - the total increase/decrease to the current account
--
-- - the report transactions' running total after this transaction;
--   or if historical balance is requested (-H), the historical running total.
--   The historical running total includes transactions from before the
--   report start date if one is specified, filtered by the report query.
--   The historical running total may or may not be the account's historical
--   running balance, depending on the report query.
--
-- Items are sorted by transaction register date (the earliest date the transaction
-- posts to the current account), most recent first.
-- Reporting intervals are currently ignored.
