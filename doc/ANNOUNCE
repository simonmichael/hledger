I'm pleased to announce hledger 1.50.3.
This release fixes a big performance regression in the 1.50 series,
so you should avoid 1.50-1.50.2 and upgrade to this one.
Thank you to contributors Caleb Maclennan and Stephen Morgan.

Best,
-Simon

hledger is free, robust, friendly, multicurrency, double-entry,
plain text accounting software for unix, mac, windows, and the web.

Written in Haskell for reliability, it is built around human-readable,
version-controllable plain text files. It is inspired by and largely
compatible with Ledger CLI, and convertible to and from Beancount.
