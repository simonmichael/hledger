NAME
       hledger-ui - robust, friendly plain text accounting (TUI version)

SYNOPSIS
       hledger-ui    [OPTS] [QUERYARGS]    # run directly
       hledger ui -- [OPTS] [QUERYARGS]    # run from hledger
DESCRIPTION
       This  manual is for hledger's terminal interface, version 1.29.99.  See
       also the hledger manual for common concepts and file formats.

       hledger is a robust, user-friendly, cross-platform set of programs  for
       tracking  money,  time,  or any other commodity, using double-entry ac-
       counting and a simple, editable file format.  hledger  is  inspired  by
       and  largely  compatible  with  ledger(1), and largely interconvertible
       with beancount(1).

       hledger-ui is hledger's  terminal  interface,  providing  an  efficient
       full-window  text  UI  for  viewing accounts and transactions, and some
       limited data entry capability.  It is easier  than  hledger's  command-
       line  interface, and sometimes quicker and more convenient than the web
       interface.

       Like hledger, it reads from (and appends to) a journal  file  specified
       by    the    LEDGER_FILE    environment    variable    (defaulting   to
       $HOME/.hledger.journal); or you can specify files with -f options.   It
       can  also  read timeclock files, timedot files, or any CSV/SSV/TSV file
       with a date field.  (See hledger(1) -> Input for details.)

       Unlike hledger, hledger-ui hides all future-dated transactions  by  de-
       fault.   They  can  be revealed, along with any rule-generated periodic
       transactions, by pressing the F key (or starting  with  --forecast)  to
       enable "forecast mode".

OPTIONS
       Any  QUERYARGS  are interpreted as a hledger search query which filters
       the data.

       hledger-ui provides the following options:

       -w --watch
              watch for data and date changes and reload automatically

       --theme=default|terminal|greenterm
              use this custom display theme

       --menu start in the menu screen

       --cash start in the cash accounts screen

       --bs   start in the balance sheet accounts screen

       --is   start in the income statement accounts screen

       --all  start in the all accounts screen

       --register=ACCTREGEX
              start in the (first) matched account's register screen

       --change
              show period balances (changes) at startup instead of  historical
              balances

       -l --flat
              show accounts as a flat list (default)

       -t --tree
              show accounts as a tree

       hledger-ui  also  supports  many  of hledger's general options (and the
       hledger manual's command line tips also apply here):

   General help options
       -h --help
              show general or COMMAND help

       --man  show general or COMMAND user manual with man

   General input options
       -f FILE --file=FILE
              use  a  different  input  file.   For  stdin,  use  -  (default:

              assignments)

       -s --strict
              do  extra error checking (check that all posted accounts are de-
              clared)

   General reporting options
       -b --begin=DATE

              preceding subperiod start when using a report interval)

       -e --end=DATE
              include postings/txns before this date (will be adjusted to fol-
              lowing subperiod end when using a report interval)

              using period expressions syntax

       --date2

              fects)

       --today=DATE
              override  today's  date  (affects  relative  smart  dates,   for
              tests/examples)

       -U --unmarked
              include only unmarked postings/txns (can combine with -P or -C)

       -P --pending
              include only pending postings/txns

       -C --cleared
              include only cleared postings/txns

              include only non-virtual postings

       -NUM --depth=NUM
              hide/aggregate accounts or postings more than NUM levels deep

       -E --empty
              show  items with zero amount, normally hidden (and vice-versa in
              hledger-ui/hledger-web)

       -B --cost
              convert amounts to their cost/selling amount at transaction time

       -V --market
              convert amounts to their market value in default valuation  com-
              modities

       -X --exchange=COMM
              convert amounts to their market value in commodity COMM

       --value
              convert  amounts  to  cost  or  market value, more flexibly than
              -B/-V/-X

       --infer-equity
              infer conversion equity postings from costs

       --infer-costs
              infer costs from conversion equity postings

       --infer-market-prices
              use costs as additional market prices, as if they were P  direc-
              tives

       --forecast
              generate  transactions  from  periodic rules, between the latest
              recorded txn and 6 months from today, or  during  the  specified
              PERIOD  (=  is required).  Auto posting rules will be applied to
              these transactions as well.  Also, in  hledger-ui  make  future-
              dated transactions visible.

       --auto generate  extra  postings  by applying auto posting rules to all
              txns (not just forecast txns)

       --verbose-tags
              add visible tags indicating transactions or postings which  have
              been generated/modified

       --commodity-style
              Override  the  commodity  style  in the output for the specified
              commodity.  For example 'EUR1.000,00'.

       --color=WHEN (or --colour=WHEN)
              Should color-supporting commands use ANSI color  codes  in  text
              output.   'auto' (default): whenever stdout seems to be a color-
              supporting terminal.  'always' or 'yes': always, useful eg  when
              piping  output  into  'less  -R'.   'never'  or  'no': never.  A
              NO_COLOR environment variable overrides this.

       --pretty[=WHEN]
              Show prettier output, e.g.  using  unicode  box-drawing  charac-
              ters.   Accepts 'yes' (the default) or 'no' ('y', 'n', 'always',
              'never' also work).  If you provide an  argument  you  must  use
              '=', e.g.  '--pretty=yes'.

       When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line, the
       last one takes precedence.

       Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.

MOUSE
       In most modern terminals, you can navigate through the screens  with  a
       mouse or touchpad:

       o Use mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll up and down

       o Click on list items to go deeper

       o Click on the left margin (column 0) to go back.

KEYS
       Keyboard gives more control.

       ?  shows a help dialog listing all keys.  (Some of these also appear in
       the quick help at the bottom of each screen.)  Press ?  again  (or  ES-
       CAPE,  or  LEFT,  or  q)  to close it.  The following keys work on most
       screens:

       The cursor keys navigate: RIGHT or ENTER goes deeper, LEFT  returns  to
       the  previous  screen,  UP/DOWN/PGUP/PGDN/HOME/END  move  up  and  down
       through lists.  Emacs-style (CTRL-p/CTRL-n/CTRL-f/CTRL-b) and  VI-style
       (k,j,l,h)  movement  keys are also supported.  A tip: movement speed is
       limited by your keyboard repeat rate, to move faster you  may  want  to
       adjust  it.   (If  you're  on a mac, the karabiner app is one way to do
       that.)

       With shift pressed, the cursor keys adjust the report period,  limiting
       the  transactions  to  be  shown  (by  default, all are shown).  SHIFT-
       DOWN/UP steps downward and upward through these standard report  period
       durations:  year,  quarter,  month,  week, day.  Then, SHIFT-LEFT/RIGHT
       moves to the previous/next period.  T sets the report period to  today.
       With  the  -w/--watch option, when viewing a "current" period (the cur-
       rent day, week, month, quarter, or year), the period will move automat-
       ically  to  track  the current date.  To set a non-standard period, you
       can use / and a date: query.

       (Mac users: SHIFT-DOWN/UP keys do not work by default in  Terminal,  as
       of  MacOS  Monterey.  You can configure them as follows: open Terminal,
       press CMD-comma to open preferences, click Profiles, select  your  cur-
       rent terminal profile on the left, click Keyboard on the right, click +
       and add this for Shift-Down: \033[1;2B, click + and add this for Shift-
       Up:  \033[1;2A.  Press the Escape key to enter the \033 part, you can't
       type it directly.)

       / lets you set a general filter query limiting the  data  shown,  using
       the  same query terms as in hledger and hledger-web.  While editing the
       query, you can use CTRL-a/e/d/k, BS, cursor keys; press  ENTER  to  set
       it, or ESCAPEto cancel.  There are also keys for quickly adjusting some
       common filters like account depth and transaction status  (see  below).
       BACKSPACE or DELETE removes all filters, showing all transactions.

       As  mentioned  above, by default hledger-ui hides future transactions -
       both ordinary transactions recorded in the journal, and periodic trans-
       actions  generated  by  rule.   F  toggles  forecast mode, in which fu-
       ture/forecasted transactions are shown.

       ESCAPE resets the UI state and jumps back to the top screen,  restoring
       the app's initial state at startup.  Or, it cancels minibuffer data en-
       try or the help dialog.

       CTRL-l redraws the screen and centers the selection if possible (selec-
       tions  near  the top won't be centered, since we don't scroll above the
       top).

       g reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen and  any
       previous  screens.   (With  large  files, this could cause a noticeable
       pause.)

       I toggles balance assertion  checking.   Disabling  balance  assertions
       temporarily can be useful for troubleshooting.

       a  runs  command-line  hledger's  add  command, and reloads the updated
       file.  This allows some basic data entry.

       A is like a, but runs the hledger-iadd tool, which provides a  terminal
       interface.   This key will be available if hledger-iadd is installed in
       $path.

       E runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR, or $EDITOR, or a default (emacsclient -a  ""
       -nw)  on  the  journal file.  With some editors (emacs, vi), the cursor
       will be positioned at the current transaction  when  invoked  from  the
       register  and transaction screens, and at the error location (if possi-
       ble) when invoked from the error screen.

       B toggles cost mode, showing amounts in their  cost's  commodity  (like
       toggling the -B/--cost flag).

       V  toggles  value  mode, showing amounts' current market value in their
       default valuation  commodity  (like  toggling  the  -V/--market  flag).
       Note,  "current market value" means the value on the report end date if
       specified, otherwise today.  To see the value on another date, you  can
       temporarily  set that as the report end date.  Eg: to see a transaction
       as it was valued on july 30, go to the  accounts  or  register  screen,
       press /, and add date:-7/30 to the query.

       At most one of cost or value mode can be active at once.

       There's  not yet any visual reminder when cost or value mode is active;
       for now pressing b b v should reliably reset to normal mode.

       q quits the application.

       Additional screen-specific keys are described below.

SCREENS
       At startup, hledger-ui shows a menu screen by default.  From  here  you
       can navigate to other screens using the cursor keys: UP/DOWN to select,
       RIGHT to move to the selected screen, LEFT to return  to  the  previous
       screen.  Or you can use ESC to return directly to the top menu screen.

       You  can  also  use a command line flag to specific a different startup
       screen (--cs, --bs, --is, --all, or --register=ACCT).

   Menu
       This is the top-most screen.  From here you  can  navigate  to  several
       screens  listing accounts of various types.  Note some of these may not
       show anything until you have configured account types.

   Cash accounts
       This screen shows "cash" (ie, liquid asset) accounts (like hledger bal-
       ancesheet  type:c).   It  always shows balances (historical ending bal-
       ances on the date shown in the title line).

   Balance sheet accounts
       This screen shows asset, liability and equity  accounts  (like  hledger
       balancesheetequity).  It always shows balances.

   Income statement accounts
       This  screen  shows revenue and expense accounts (like hledger incomes-
       tatement).  It always shows changes  (balance  changes  in  the  period
       shown in the title line).

   All accounts
       This  screen  shows  all accounts in your journal (unless filtered by a
       query; like hledger balance).  It shows balances by  default;  you  can
       toggle showing changes with the H key.

   Register
       This  screen  shows  the  transactions  affecting a particular account.
       Each line represents one transaction, and shows:

       o the other account(s) involved, in abbreviated form.   (If  there  are
         both  real  and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts affected
         by real postings.)

       o the overall change to the current account's balance; positive for  an
         inflow to this account, negative for an outflow.

       o the running total after the transaction.  With the H key you can tog-
         gle between

         o the period total, which is from just the transactions displayed

         o or the historical total, which includes  any  undisplayed  transac-
           tions  before the start of the report period (and matching the fil-
           ter query if any).  This will be  the  running  historical  balance
           (what  you would see on a bank's website, eg) if not disturbed by a
           query.

       Transactions affecting this account's subaccounts will be  included  in
       the register if the accounts screen is in tree mode, or if it's in list
       mode but this account has subaccounts which are  not  shown  due  to  a
       depth  limit.   In  other words, the register always shows the transac-
       tions contributing to the balance shown on the accounts  screen.   Tree
       mode/list mode can be toggled with t here also.

       U  toggles  filtering  by  unmarked  status, showing or hiding unmarked
       transactions.  Similarly, P toggles pending transactions, and C toggles
       cleared  transactions.  (By default, transactions with all statuses are
       shown; if you activate one or two status filters, only  those  transac-
       tions are shown; and if you activate all three, the filter is removed.)

       R toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

       z  toggles  nonzero  mode, in which only transactions posting a nonzero
       change are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default,  unlike  com-
       mand-line hledger).

       Press RIGHT to view the selected transaction in detail.

   Transaction
       This  screen  shows  a  single transaction, as a general journal entry,
       similar to hledger's print command and  journal  format  (hledger_jour-
       nal(5)).

       The  transaction's  date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code, de-
       scription, comments, along with all of its account postings are  shown.
       Simple  transactions  have  two  postings, but there can be more (or in
       certain cases, fewer).

       UP and DOWN will step through all transactions listed in  the  previous
       account  register screen.  In the title bar, the numbers in parentheses
       show your position within that account register.  They  will  vary  de-
       pending on which account register you came from (remember most transac-
       tions appear in multiple account registers).  The #N  number  preceding
       them is the transaction's position within the complete unfiltered jour-
       nal, which is a more stable id (at least until the next reload).

       On this screen (and the register screen), the E key will open your text
       editor  with the cursor positioned at the current transaction if possi-
       ble.

       This screen has a limitation with showing file  updates:  it  will  not
       show  them  until you exit and re-enter it.  So eg to see the effect of
       using the E key, currently you must: - press E, edit and save the file,
       then  exit  the editor, returning to hledger-ui - press g to reload the
       file (or use -w/--watch mode) - press LEFT then RIGHT to exit  and  re-
       enter the transaction screen.

   Error
       This  screen  will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
       when you press g to reload.  Once you have fixed the problem,  press  g
       again to reload and resume normal operation.  (Or, you can press escape
       to cancel the reload attempt.)

TIPS
   Watch mode
       One of hledger-ui's best  features  is  the  auto-reloading  -w/--watch
       mode.   With  this flag, it will update the display automatically when-
       ever changes are saved to the data files.

       This is very useful when reconciling.  A good workflow is to have  your
       bank's  online  register  open  in a browser window, for reference; the
       journal file open in an editor window; and hledger-ui in watch mode  in
       a terminal window, eg:

              $ hledger-ui --watch --register checking -C

       As  you mark things cleared in the editor, you can see the effect imme-
       diately without having to context  switch.   This  leaves  more  mental
       bandwidth  for  your accounting.  Of course you can still interact with
       hledger-ui when needed, eg to toggle cleared mode, or  to  explore  the
       history.

       There are currently some limitations with --watch:

       It may not work correctly for you, depending on platform or system con-
       figuration.  (Eg #836.)

       At least on mac, there can be a slow build-up of CPU usage  over  time,
       until  the  program  is  restarted  (or, suspending and restarting with
       CTRL-z fg may be enough).

       It will not detect file changes made by certain editors, such  as  Jet-
       brains  IDEs or gedit, or on certain less common filesystems.  (To work
       around,  press  g  to  reload  manually,   or   try   #1617's   fs.ino-
       tify.max_user_watches workaround and let us know.)

       If  you  are  viewing  files  mounted  from another machine, the system
       clocks on both machines should be roughly in agreement.

   Debug output
       You can add --debug[=N] to the command line to log debug output.   This
       will  be logged to the file hledger-ui.log in the current directory.  N
       ranges from 1 (least output, the default) to 9 (maximum output).

ENVIRONMENT
       COLUMNS The screen width to use.  Default: the full terminal width.

       LEDGER_FILE The main journal  file  to  use  when  not  specified  with
       -f/--file.  Default: $HOME/.hledger.journal.

BUGS
       We  welcome  bug  reports  in  the  hledger  issue  tracker  (shortcut:
       http://bugs.hledger.org), or on the #hledger chat or hledger mail  list
       (https://hledger.org/support).

       Some known issues:

       -f- doesn't work (hledger-ui can't read from stdin).

       If you press g with large files, there could be a noticeable pause.

       The Transaction screen does not update from file changes until you exit
       and re-endter it (see SCREENS > Transaction above).

       --watch is not yet fully  robust  on  all  platforms  (see  Watch  mode
       above).
