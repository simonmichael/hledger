cashflow, cf
This command displays a simple cashflow statement, showing changes in
"cash" accounts. It assumes that these accounts are under a top-level
asset account (case insensitive, plural forms also allowed) and do not
contain receivable or A/R in their name. Note this report shows all
account balances with normal positive sign (like conventional financial
statements, unlike balance/print/register) (experimental).

_FLAGS_

Example:

$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement

Cash flows:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Total:
--------------------
                 $-1

With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
report period. Normally cashflow shows changes in assets per period,
though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the report mode
with --change/--cumulative/--historical.

This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.
