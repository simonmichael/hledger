hledger_csv(5) hledger 1.16.99
******************************

hledger can read CSV (comma-separated value, or character-separated
value) files as if they were journal files, automatically converting
each CSV record into a transaction.  (To learn about _writing_ CSV, see
CSV output.)

   We describe each CSV file's format with a corresponding _rules file_.
By default this is named like the CSV file with a '.rules' extension
added.  Eg when reading 'FILE.csv', hledger also looks for
'FILE.csv.rules' in the same directory.  You can specify a different
rules file with the '--rules-file' option.  If a rules file is not
found, hledger will create a sample rules file, which you'll need to
adjust.

   This file contains rules describing the CSV data (header line, fields
layout, date format etc.), and how to construct hledger journal entries
(transactions) from it.  Often there will also be a list of conditional
rules for categorising transactions based on their descriptions.  Here's
an overview of the CSV rules; these are described more fully below,
after the examples:

*'skip'*           skip one or more header lines or matched CSV records
*'fields'*         name CSV fields, assign them to hledger fields
*field             assign a value to one hledger field, with interpolation
assignment*
*'if'*             apply some rules to matched CSV records
*'end'*            skip the remaining CSV records
*'date-format'*    describe the format of CSV dates
*'newest-first'*   disambiguate record order when there's only one date
*'include'*        inline another CSV rules file

   There's also a Convert CSV files tutorial on hledger.org.

1.1 Basic
=========

At minimum, the rules file must identify the date and amount fields, and
often it also specifies the date format and how many header lines there
are.  Here's a simple CSV file and a rules file for it:

Date, Description, Id, Amount
12/11/2019, Foo, 123, 10.23

# basic.csv.rules
skip         1
fields       date, description, _, amount
date-format  %d/%m/%Y

$ hledger print -f basic.csv
2019/11/12 Foo
    expenses:unknown           10.23
    income:unknown            -10.23

   Default account names are chosen, since we didn't set them.

1.2 Bank of Ireland
===================

Here's a CSV with two amount fields (Debit and Credit), and a balance
field, which we can use to add balance assertions, which is not
necessary but provides extra error checking:

Date,Details,Debit,Credit,Balance
07/12/2012,LODGMENT       529898,,10.0,131.21
07/12/2012,PAYMENT,5,,126

# bankofireland-checking.csv.rules

# skip the header line
skip

# name the csv fields, and assign some of them as journal entry fields
fields  date, description, amount-out, amount-in, balance

# We generate balance assertions by assigning to "balance"
# above, but you may sometimes need to remove these because:
#
# - the CSV balance differs from the true balance, 
#   by up to 0.0000000000005 in my experience
#
# - it is sometimes calculated based on non-chronological ordering,
#   eg when multiple transactions clear on the same day

# date is in UK/Ireland format
date-format  %d/%m/%Y

# set the currency
currency  EUR

# set the base account for all txns
account1  assets:bank:boi:checking

$ hledger -f bankofireland-checking.csv print
2012/12/07 LODGMENT       529898
    assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR10.0 = EUR131.2
    income:unknown                  EUR-10.0

2012/12/07 PAYMENT
    assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR-5.0 = EUR126.0
    expenses:unknown                  EUR5.0

   The balance assertions don't raise an error above, because we're
reading directly from CSV, but they will be checked if these entries are
imported into a journal file.

1.3 Amazon
==========

Here we convert amazon.com order history, and use an if block to
generate a third posting if there's a fee.  (In practice you'd probably
get this data from your bank instead, but it's an example.)

2 CSV RULES
***********

The following kinds of rule can appear in the rules file, in any order.
Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored.

* fields::
* field assignment::
* if::
* end::

File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: skip,  Next: fields,  Up: CSV RULES

2.1 'skip'
==========

skip N

   The word "skip" followed by a number (or no number, meaning 1) tells
hledger to ignore this many non-empty lines preceding the CSV data.
(Empty/blank lines are skipped automatically.)  You'll need this
whenever your CSV data contains header lines.

   It also has a second purpose: it can be used inside if blocks to
ignore certain CSV records (described below).


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: fields,  Next: field assignment,  Prev: skip,  Up: CSV RULES

2.2 'fields'
============

fields FIELDNAME1, FIELDNAME2, ...

   A fields list (the word "fields" followed by comma-separated field
names) is the quick way to assign CSV field values to hledger fields.
It does two things:

  1. it names the CSV fields.  This is optional, but can be convenient
     later for interpolating them.

  2. when you use a standard hledger field name, it assigns the CSV
     value to that part of the hledger transaction.

   Here's an example that says "use the 1st, 2nd and 4th fields as the
transaction's date, description and amount; name the last two fields for
later reference; and ignore the others":

fields date, description, , amount, , , somefield, anotherfield

   Field names may not contain whitespace.  Fields you don't care about
can be left unnamed.  Currently there must be least two items (there
must be at least one comma).

   Note, always use comma in the fields list, even if your CSV uses
another separator character.

   Here are the standard hledger field/pseudo-field names.  For more
about the transaction parts they refer to, see the manual for hledger's
journal format.

* Menu:

* Transaction field names::
* Posting field names::


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Transaction field names,  Next: Posting field names,  Up: fields

2.2.1 Transaction field names
-----------------------------

'date', 'date2', 'status', 'code', 'description', 'comment' can be used
to form the transaction's first line.


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Posting field names,  Prev: Transaction field names,  Up: fields

2.2.2 Posting field names
-------------------------

'accountN', where N is 1 to 9, generates a posting, with that account
name.  Most often there are two postings, so you'll want to set
'account1' and 'account2'.  If a posting's account name is left unset
but its amount is set, a default account name will be chosen (like
expenses:unknown or income:unknown).

   'amountN' sets posting N's amount.  Or, 'amount' with no N sets
posting 1's.  If the CSV has debits and credits in separate fields, use
'amountN-in' and 'amountN-out' instead.  Or 'amount-in' and 'amount-out'
with no N for posting 1.

   For convenience and backwards compatibility, if you set the amount of
posting 1 only, a second posting with the negative amount will be
generated automatically.  (Unless the account name is parenthesised
indicating an unbalanced posting.)

   If the CSV has the currency symbol in a separate field, you can use
'currencyN' to prepend it to posting N's amount.  'currency' with no N
affects ALL postings.

   'balanceN' sets a balance assertion amount (or if the posting amount
is left empty, a balance assignment).  You may need to adjust this with
the 'balance-type' rule.

   Finally, 'commentN' sets a comment on the Nth posting.  Comments can
also contain tags, as usual.

   See TIPS below for more about setting amounts and currency.


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: field assignment,  Next: if,  Prev: fields,  Up: CSV RULES

2.3 field assignment
====================

HLEDGERFIELDNAME FIELDVALUE

   Instead of or in addition to a fields list, you can use a "field
assignment" rule to set the value of a single hledger field, by writing
its name (any of the standard hledger field names above) followed by a
text value.  The value may contain interpolated CSV fields, referenced
by their 1-based position in the CSV record ('%N'), or by the name they
were given in the fields list ('%CSVFIELDNAME').  Some examples:

# set the amount to the 4th CSV field, with " USD" appended
amount %4 USD

# combine three fields to make a comment, containing note: and date: tags
comment note: %somefield - %anotherfield, date: %1

   Interpolation strips outer whitespace (so a CSV value like '" 1 "'
becomes '1' when interpolated) (#1051).  See TIPS below for more about
referencing other fields.


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: if,  Next: end,  Prev: field assignment,  Up: CSV RULES

2.4 'if'
========

if PATTERN
 RULE

if
PATTERN
PATTERN
PATTERN
 RULE
 RULE

   Conditional blocks ("if blocks") are a block of rules that are
applied only to CSV records which match certain patterns.  They are
often used for customising account names based on transaction
descriptions.

   A single pattern can be written on the same line as the "if"; or
multiple patterns can be written on the following lines, non-indented.
Multiple patterns are OR'd (any one of them can match).  Patterns are
case-insensitive regular expressions which try to match anywhere within
the whole CSV record (POSIX extended regular expressions with some
additions, see https://hledger.org/hledger.html#regular-expressions).
Note the CSV record they see is close to, but not identical to, the one
in the CSV file; enclosing double quotes will be removed, and the
separator character is always comma.

   It's not yet easy to match within a specific field.  If the data does
not contain commas, you can hack it with a regular expression like:

# match "foo" in the fourth field
if ^([^,]*,){3}foo

   After the patterns there should be one or more rules to apply, all
indented by at least one space.  Three kinds of rule are allowed in
conditional blocks:

   * field assignments (to set a hledger field)
   * skip (to skip the matched CSV record)
   * end (to skip all remaining CSV records).

   Examples:

# if the CSV record contains "groceries", set account2 to "expenses:groceries"
if groceries
 account2 expenses:groceries

# if the CSV record contains any of these patterns, set account2 and comment as shown
if
monthly service fee
atm transaction fee
banking thru software
 account2 expenses:business:banking
 comment  XXX deductible ? check it


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: end,  Next: date-format,  Prev: if,  Up: CSV RULES

2.5 'end'
=========

This rule can be used inside if blocks (only), to make hledger stop
reading this CSV file and move on to the next input file, or to command
execution.  Eg:

# ignore everything following the first empty record
if ,,,,
 end


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: date-format,  Next: newest-first,  Prev: end,  Up: CSV RULES

2.6 'date-format'
=================

date-format DATEFMT

   This is a helper for the 'date' (and 'date2') fields.  If your CSV
dates are not formatted like 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY/MM/DD' or 'YYYY.MM.DD',
you'll need to add a date-format rule describing them with a strptime
date parsing pattern, which must parse the CSV date value completely.
Some examples:

# MM/DD/YY
date-format %m/%d/%y

# D/M/YYYY
# The - makes leading zeros optional.
date-format %-d/%-m/%Y

# YYYY-Mmm-DD
date-format %Y-%h-%d

# M/D/YYYY HH:MM AM some other junk
# Note the time and junk must be fully parsed, though only the date is used.
date-format %-m/%-d/%Y %l:%M %p some other junk

   For the supported strptime syntax, see:
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#v:formatTime


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: newest-first,  Next: include,  Prev: date-format,  Up: CSV RULES

2.7 'newest-first'
==================

hledger always sorts the generated transactions by date.  Transactions
on the same date should appear in the same order as their CSV records,
as hledger can usually auto-detect whether the CSV's normal order is
oldest first or newest first.  But if all of the following are true:

   * the CSV might sometimes contain just one day of data (all records
     having the same date)
   * the CSV records are normally in reverse chronological order (newest
     at the top)
   * and you care about preserving the order of same-day transactions

   then, you should add the 'newest-first' rule as a hint.  Eg:

# tell hledger explicitly that the CSV is normally newest first
newest-first


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: include,  Next: balance-type,  Prev: newest-first,  Up: CSV RULES

2.8 'include'
=============

include RULESFILE

   This includes the contents of another CSV rules file at this point.
'RULESFILE' is an absolute file path or a path relative to the current
file's directory.  This can be useful for sharing common rules between
several rules files, eg:

# someaccount.csv.rules

## someaccount-specific rules

2.9 'balance-type'
==================

Balance assertions generated by assigning to balanceN are of the simple
'=' type by default, which is a single-commodity, subaccount-excluding
assertion.  You may find the subaccount-including variants more useful,
eg if you have created some virtual subaccounts of checking to help with
budgeting.  You can select a different type of assertion with the
'balance-type' rule:

# balance assertions will consider all commodities and all subaccounts
balance-type ==*

   Here are the balance assertion types for quick reference:

=    single commodity, exclude subaccounts
=*   single commodity, include subaccounts
==   multi commodity,  exclude subaccounts
==*  multi commodity,  include subaccounts

3.1 Rapid feedback
==================

It's a good idea to get rapid feedback while creating/troubleshooting
CSV rules.  Here's a good way, using entr from
http://eradman.com/entrproject :

$ ls foo.csv* | entr bash -c 'echo ----; hledger -f foo.csv print desc:SOMEDESC'

   A desc: query (eg) is used to select just one, or a few, transactions
of interest.  "bash -c" is used to run multiple commands, so we can echo
a separator each time the command re-runs, making it easier to read the
output.

3.2 Valid CSV
=============

hledger accepts CSV conforming to RFC 4180.  When CSV values are
enclosed in quotes, note:

   * they must be double quotes (not single quotes)
   * spaces outside the quotes are not allowed


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Other separator characters,  Next: Reading multiple CSV files,  Prev: Valid CSV,  Up: TIPS

3.3 Other separator characters
==============================

You can use the '--separator 'CHAR'' command line option (experimental)
to read other kinds of character-separated data.  Eg to read SSV
(Semicolon Separated Values), use:

$ hledger -f foo.tsv --separator ';' print

   Note the semicolon is quoted because it's a special shell character.

   To read TSV (Tab Separated Values), use:

$ hledger -f foo.tsv --separator '  ' print

   Note, that's a real tab character in quotes, not '\t'.

3.4 Reading multiple CSV files
==============================

If you use multiple '-f' options to read multiple CSV files at once,
hledger will look for a correspondingly-named rules file for each CSV
file.  But if you use the '--rules-file' option, that rules file will be
used for all the CSV files.


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Valid transactions,  Next: Deduplicating importing,  Prev: Reading multiple CSV files,  Up: TIPS

3.5 Valid transactions
======================

After reading a CSV file, hledger post-processes and validates the
generated journal entries as it would for a journal file - balancing
them, applying balance assignments, and canonicalising amount styles.
Any errors at this stage will be reported in the usual way, displaying
the problem entry.

   There is one exception: balance assertions, if you have generated
them, will not be checked, since normally these will work only when the
CSV data is part of the main journal.  If you do need to check balance
assertions generated from CSV right away, pipe into another hledger:

$ hledger -f file.csv print | hledger -f- print


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Deduplicating importing,  Next: Setting amounts,  Prev: Valid transactions,  Up: TIPS

3.6 Deduplicating, importing
============================

When you download a CSV file periodically, eg to get your latest bank
transactions, the new file may overlap with the old one, containing some
of the same records.

   The import command will (a) detect the new transactions, and (b)
append just those transactions to your main journal.  It is idempotent,
so you don't have to remember how many times you ran it or with which
version of the CSV. (It keeps state in a hidden '.latest.FILE.csv'
file.)  This is the easiest way to import CSV data.  Eg:

# download the latest CSV files, then run this command.
# Note, no -f flags needed here.
$ hledger import *.csv [--dry]

   This method works for most CSV files.  (Where records have a stable
chronological order, and new records appear only at the new end.)

   A number of other tools and workflows, hledger-specific and
otherwise, exist for converting, deduplicating, classifying and managing
CSV data.  See:

   * https://hledger.org -> sidebar -> real world setups
   * https://plaintextaccounting.org -> data import/conversion


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Setting amounts,  Next: Setting currency/commodity,  Prev: Deduplicating importing,  Up: TIPS

3.7 Setting amounts
===================

A posting amount can be set in one of these ways:

   * by assigning (with a fields list or field assigment) to 'amountN'
     (posting N's amount) or 'amount' (posting 1's amount)

   * by assigning to 'amountN-in' and 'amountN-out' (or 'amount-in' and
     'amount-out').  For each CSV record, whichever of these has a
     non-zero value will be used, with appropriate sign.  If both
     contain a non-zero value, this may not work.

   * by assigning to 'balanceN' (or 'balance') instead of the above,
     setting the amount indirectly via a balance assignment.  If you do
     this the default account name may be wrong, so you should set that
     explicitly.

   There is some special handling for an amount's sign:

   * If an amount value is parenthesised, it will be de-parenthesised
     and sign-flipped.
   * If an amount value begins with a double minus sign, those cancel
     out and are removed.
   * If an amount value begins with a plus sign, that will be removed

3.8 Setting currency/commodity
==============================

If the currency/commodity symbol is included in the CSV's amount
field(s), you don't have to do anything special.

   If the currency is provided as a separate CSV field, you can either:

   * assign that to 'currency', which adds it to all posting amounts.
     The symbol will prepended to the amount quantity (on the left
     side).  If you write a trailing space after the symbol, there will
     be a space between symbol and amount (an exception to the usual
     whitespace stripping).

   * or assign it to 'currencyN' which adds it to posting N's amount
     only.

   * or for more control, construct the amount from symbol and quantity
     using field assignment, eg:

     fields date,description,currency,quantity
     # add currency symbol on the right:
     amount %quantity %currency


File: hledger_csv.info,  Node: Referencing other fields,  Next: How CSV rules are evaluated,  Prev: Setting currency/commodity,  Up: TIPS

3.9 Referencing other fields
============================

In field assignments, you can interpolate only CSV fields, not hledger
fields.  In the example below, there's both a CSV field and a hledger
field named amount1, but %amount1 always means the CSV field, not the
hledger field:

# Name the third CSV field "amount1"
fields date,description,amount1

# Set hledger's amount1 to the CSV amount1 field followed by USD
amount1 %amount1 USD

# Set comment to the CSV amount1 (not the amount1 assigned above)
comment %amount1

   Here, since there's no CSV amount1 field, %amount1 will produce a
literal "amount1":

fields date,description,csvamount
amount1 %csvamount USD
# Can't interpolate amount1 here
comment %amount1

   When there are multiple field assignments to the same hledger field,
only the last one takes effect.  Here, comment's value will be be B, or
C if "something" is matched, but never A:

comment A
comment B
if something
 comment C

3.10 How CSV rules are evaluated
================================

Here's how to think of CSV rules being evaluated (if you really need
to).  First,

   * 'include' - all includes are inlined, from top to bottom, depth
     first.  (At each include point the file is inlined and scanned for
     further includes, recursively, before proceeding.)

   Then "global" rules are evaluated, top to bottom.  If a rule is
repeated, the last one wins:

   * 'skip' (at top level)
   * 'date-format'
   * 'newest-first'
   * 'fields' - names the CSV fields, optionally sets up initial
     assignments to hledger fields

   Then for each CSV record in turn:

   * test all 'if' blocks.  If any of them contain a 'end' rule, skip
     all remaining CSV records.  Otherwise if any of them contain a
     'skip' rule, skip that many CSV records.  If there are multiple
     matched 'skip' rules, the first one wins.
   * collect all field assignments at top level and in matched 'if'
     blocks.  When there are multiple assignments for a field, keep only
     the last one.
   * compute a value for each hledger field - either the one that was
     assigned to it (and interpolate the %CSVFIELDNAME references), or a
     default
   * generate a synthetic hledger transaction from these values.

   This is all part of the CSV reader, one of several readers hledger
can use to parse input files.  When all files have been read
successfully, the transactions are passed as input to whichever hledger
command the user specified.
