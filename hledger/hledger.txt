NAME
       hledger - a command-line accounting tool

SYNOPSIS
       hledger [-f FILE] COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]
       hledger [-f FILE] ADDONCMD -- [OPTIONS] [ARGS]
       hledger

DESCRIPTION
       hledger  is  a  cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
       other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a  simple,  editable
       file  format.   hledger  is  inspired  by  and  largely compatible with
       ledger(1).
       Tested on unix, mac, windows, hledger aims to be a reliable,  practical
       tool for daily use.

       This  is  hledger's command-line interface (there are also terminal and
       web interfaces).  Its basic function is to read a plain text  file  de-
       scribing  financial  transactions (in accounting terms, a general jour-
       nal) and print useful reports on standard output,  or  export  them  as
       CSV.   hledger can also read some other file formats such as CSV files,
       translating them to journal format.  Additionally, hledger lists  other
       hledger-*  executables found in the user's $PATH and can invoke them as
       subcommands.

       hledger reads data from one or more files  in  hledger  journal,  time-
       clock,  timedot,  or  CSV format specified with -f, or $LEDGER_FILE, or
       $HOME/.hledger.journal          (on          windows,           perhaps
       C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal).  If using $LEDGER_FILE, note this must
       be a real environment variable, not a shell variable.  You can  specify
       standard input with -f-.

       Transactions  are  dated movements of money between two (or more) named
       accounts, and are recorded with journal entries like this:

              2015/10/16 bought food
               expenses:food          $10
               assets:cash

       For more about this format, see hledger_journal(5).

       Most users use a text editor to edit the journal, usually with an  edi-
       tor mode such as ledger-mode for added convenience.  hledger's interac-
       tive add command is another way to record  new  transactions.   hledger
       never changes existing transactions.

       To  get  started,  you  can  either save some entries like the above in
       ~/.hledger.journal, or run hledger add and follow  the  prompts.   Then
       try  some  commands like hledger print or hledger balance.  Run hledger
       with no arguments for a list of commands.

EXAMPLES
       Two simple transactions in hledger journal format:

              2015/9/30 gift received
                assets:cash   $20
                income:gifts

              2015/10/16 farmers market
                expenses:food    $10
                assets:cash

       Some basic reports:

              $ hledger print
              2015/09/30 gift received
                  assets:cash            $20
                  income:gifts          $-20

              2015/10/16 farmers market
                  expenses:food           $10
                  assets:cash            $-10

              $ hledger accounts --tree
              assets
                cash
              expenses
                food
              income
                gifts

              $ hledger balance
                               $10  assets:cash
                               $10  expenses:food
                              $-20  income:gifts
              --------------------
                                 0

              $ hledger register cash
              2015/09/30 gift received   assets:cash               $20           $20
              2015/10/16 farmers market  assets:cash              $-10           $10

              apply periodic transaction rules  to  generate  future  transac-
              tions, to 6 months from now or report end date.

       When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line, the
       last one takes precedence.

       Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.

   Command options
       To see options for a particular command, including command-specific op-
       tions, run: hledger COMMAND -h.

       Command-specific  options  must  be written after the command name, eg:
       hledger print -x.

       Additionally, if the command is an addon, you may need to put  its  op-
       tions  after  a  double-hyphen, eg: hledger ui -- --watch.  Or, you can
       run the addon executable directly: hledger-ui --watch.

   Command arguments
       Most hledger commands accept arguments after the  command  name,  which
       are often a query, filtering the data in some way.

   Argument files
       You can save a set of command line options/arguments in a file, one per
       line, and then reuse them by writing @FILENAME in a command  line.   To
       prevent this expansion of @-arguments, precede them with a -- argument.
       For more, see Save frequently used options.

   Special characters in arguments and queries
       In shell command lines, option and argument values which contain "prob-
       lematic" characters, ie spaces, and also characters significant to your
       shell such as <, >, (, ), | and $, should be escaped by enclosing  them
       in quotes or by writing backslashes before the characters.  Eg:

       hledger   register   -p   'last  year'  "accounts  receivable  (receiv-
       able|payable)" amt:\>100.

   More escaping
       Characters significant both to the shell and in regular expressions may
       need  one extra level of escaping.  These include parentheses, the pipe
       symbol and the dollar sign.  Eg, to match the dollar symbol, bash users
       should do:

       hledger balance cur:'\$'

       or:

       hledger balance cur:\\$

   Even more escaping
       When  hledger runs an addon executable (eg you type hledger ui, hledger
       runs hledger-ui), it  de-escapes  command-line  options  and  arguments
       once,  so  you might need to triple-escape.  Eg in bash, running the ui
       command and matching the dollar sign, it's:

       hledger ui cur:'\\$'

       or:

       hledger ui cur:\\\\$

       If you asked why four slashes above, this may help:

       unescaped:        $
       escaped:          \$
       double-escaped:   \\$
       triple-escaped:   \\\\$

       (The number of backslashes in fish shell is left as an exercise for the
       reader.)

       You can always avoid the extra escaping for addons by running the addon
       directly:

       hledger-ui cur:\\$

   Less escaping
       Inside an argument file, or  in  the  search  field  of  hledger-ui  or
       hledger-web,  or  at a GHCI prompt, you need one less level of escaping
       than at the command line.  And backslashes may work better than quotes.
       Eg:

       ghci> :main balance cur:\$

   Command line tips
       If in doubt, keep things simple:

       o write options after the command (hledger CMD -OPTIONS ARGS)

       o run add-on executables directly (hledger-ui -OPTIONS ARGS)

       o enclose problematic args in single quotes

       o if needed, also add a backslash to escape regexp metacharacters

       To  find  out exactly how a command line is being parsed, add --debug=2
       to troubleshoot.

   Unicode characters
       hledger is expected to handle non-ascii characters correctly:

       o they should be parsed correctly in input files  and  on  the  command
         line,  by all hledger tools (add, iadd, hledger-web's search/add/edit
         forms, etc.)

       o they should be displayed correctly by  all  hledger  tools,  and  on-
         screen alignment should be preserved.

       This requires a well-configured environment.  Here are some tips:

       o A  system  locale must be configured, and it must be one that can de-
         code the characters being used.  In bash, you can set a  locale  like
         this:  export LANG=en_US.UTF-8.  There are some more details in Trou-
         bleshooting.  This step is essential - without it, hledger will  quit
         on  encountering a non-ascii character (as with all GHC-compiled pro-
         grams).

       o your terminal software (eg  Terminal.app,  iTerm,  CMD.exe,  xterm..)
         must support unicode

       o the terminal must be using a font which includes the required unicode
         glyphs

       o the terminal should be configured to display wide characters as  dou-
         ble width (for report alignment)

       o on  Windows, for best results you should run hledger in the same kind
         of environment in which it was built.  Eg hledger built in the  stan-
         dard  CMD.EXE  environment  (like  the binaries on our download page)
         might show display problems when run in a cygwin  or  msys  terminal,
         and vice versa.  (See eg #961).

   Input files
       hledger reads transactions from a data file (and the add command writes
       to it).  By default this file is $HOME/.hledger.journal (or on Windows,
       something  like C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal).  You can override this
       with the $LEDGER_FILE environment variable:

              $ setenv LEDGER_FILE ~/finance/2016.journal
              $ hledger stats

       or with the -f/--file option:

              $ hledger -f /some/file stats

       The file name - (hyphen) means standard input:

              $ cat some.journal | hledger -f-

       Usually the data file is in hledger's journal format, but it  can  also
       be  one  of  several  other formats, listed below.  hledger detects the
       format automatically based on the file extension, or  if  that  is  not
       recognised, by trying each built-in "reader" in turn:

       Reader:    Reads:                            Used for file extensions:
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       journal    hledger's  journal format, also   .journal .j .hledger .ledger
                  some Ledger journals
       time-      timeclock  files  (precise time   .timeclock
       clock      logging)
       timedot    timedot files (approximate time   .timedot
                  logging)
       csv        comma-separated   values  (data   .csv
                  interchange)

       If needed (eg to ensure correct error messages  when  a  file  has  the
       "wrong"  extension), you can force a specific reader/format by prepend-
       ing it to the file path with a colon.  Examples:

              $ hledger -f csv:/some/csv-file.dat stats
              $ echo 'i 2009/13/1 08:00:00' | hledger print -ftimeclock:-

       You can also specify multiple -f options, to read multiple files as one
       big journal.  There are some limitations with this:

       o directives in one file will not affect the other files

       o balance  assertions  will  not see any account balances from previous
         files

       If you need those, either use the include directive, or concatenate the
       files, eg: cat a.journal b.journal | hledger -f- CMD.

   Smart dates
       hledger's user interfaces accept a flexible "smart date" syntax (unlike
       dates in the journal file).  Smart dates allow some english words,  can
       be  relative  to today's date, and can have less-significant date parts
       omitted (defaulting to 1).

       Examples:

       2004/10/1,     2004-01-01,   exact  date, several sepa-
       2004.9.1                     rators allowed.   Year  is
                                    4+  digits, month is 1-12,
                                    day is 1-31
       2004                         start of year
       2004/10                      start of month
       10/1                         month and day  in  current
                                    year
       21                           day in current month
       october, oct                 start  of month in current
                                    year
       yesterday, today, tomorrow   -1, 0, 1 days from today
       last/this/next               -1, 0, 1 periods from  the
       day/week/month/quar-         current period
       ter/year
       20181201                     8   digit   YYYYMMDD  with
                                    valid year month and day
       201812                       6 digit YYYYMM with  valid
                                    year and month

       Counterexamples  -  malformed digit sequences might give surprising re-
       sults:

       201813      6 digits with  an  invalid
                   month  is  parsed as start
                   of 6-digit year
       20181301    8 digits with  an  invalid
                   month  is  parsed as start
                   of 8-digit year
       20181232    8 digits with  an  invalid
                   day gives an error
       201801012   9+ digits beginning with a
                   valid  YYYYMMDD  gives  an
                   error

   Report start & end date
       Most  hledger  reports  show  the  full span of time represented by the
       journal data, by default.  So, the effective report start and end dates
       will  be  the earliest and latest transaction or posting dates found in
       the journal.

       Often you will want to see a shorter time span,  such  as  the  current
       month.   You  can  specify  a  start  and/or end date using -b/--begin,
       -e/--end, -p/--period or a date: query (described below).  All of these
       accept the smart date syntax.

       Some notes:

       o As  in Ledger, end dates are exclusive, so you need to write the date
         after the last day you want to include.

       o As noted in reporting options: among start/end dates  specified  with
         options, the last (i.e.  right-most) option takes precedence.

       o The  effective report start and end dates are the intersection of the
         start/end dates from options and that from date: queries.   That  is,
         date:2019-01  date:2019  -p'2000  to  2030'  yields January 2019, the
         smallest common time span.

       Examples:

       -b 2016/3/17      begin  on  St.   Patrick's
                         day 2016




       -e 12/1           end at the start of decem-
                         ber  1st  of  the  current
                         year  (11/30  will  be the

   Report intervals
       A report interval can be specified so that commands like register, bal-
       ance  and  activity will divide their reports into multiple subperiods.
       The  basic  intervals  can  be  selected  with   one   of   -D/--daily,
       -W/--weekly,  -M/--monthly,  -Q/--quarterly, or -Y/--yearly.  More com-
       plex intervals may be specified with a period expression.   Report  in-
       tervals can not be specified with a query.

   Period expressions
       The  -p/--period  option accepts period expressions, a shorthand way of
       expressing a start date, end date, and/or report interval all at once.

       Here's a basic period expression specifying the first quarter of  2009.
       Note,  hledger  always treats start dates as inclusive and end dates as
       exclusive:

       -p "from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"

       Keywords like "from" and "to" are optional, and so are the  spaces,  as
       long  as you don't run two dates together.  "to" can also be written as
       "-".  These are equivalent to the above:

       -p "2009/1/1 2009/4/1"
       -p2009/1/1to2009/4/1
       -p2009/1/1-2009/4/1

       Dates are smart dates, so if the current year is 2009,  the  above  can
       also be written as:

       -p "1/1 4/1"
       -p "january-apr"
       -p "this year to 4/1"

       If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be the
       earliest or latest transaction in your journal:

       -p "from 2009/1/1"   everything  after  january
                            1, 2009
       -p "from 2009/1"     the same
       -p "from 2009"       the same
       -p "to 2009"         everything  before january
                            1, 2009

       A single date with no "from" or "to" defines both  the  start  and  end
       date like so:

       -p "2009"       the  year 2009; equivalent
                       to "2009/1/1 to 2010/1/1"
       -p "2009/1"     the month of jan;  equiva-
                       lent   to   "2009/1/1   to
                       2009/2/1"


       -p "2009/1/1"   just that day;  equivalent
                       to "2009/1/1 to 2009/1/2"

       The  argument  of  -p can also begin with, or be, a report interval ex-
       pression.  The basic report intervals are daily, weekly, monthly, quar-
       terly,  or yearly, which have the same effect as the -D,-W,-M,-Q, or -Y
       flags.  Between report interval and start/end dates (if any), the  word
       in is optional.  Examples:

       -p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"
       -p "monthly in 2008"
       -p "quarterly"

       Note  that  weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly intervals will always
       start on the first day on week, month, quarter or year accordingly, and
       will  end on the last day of same period, even if associated period ex-
       pression specifies different explicit start and end date.

       For example:

       -p "weekly from 2009/1/1  to  2009/4/1"
       --  starts  on 2008/12/29, closest pre-
       ceeding Monday
       -p "monthly in 2008/11/25" -- starts on
       2018/11/01
       -p   "quarterly   from   2009-05-05  to
       2009-06-01"  -  starts  on  2009/04/01,
       ends on 2009/06/30, which are first and
       last days of Q2 2009
       -p "yearly from 2009-12-29" - starts on
       2009/01/01, first day of 2009

       The  following  more  complex  report intervals are also supported: bi-
       weekly,   bimonthly,   every   day|week|month|quarter|year,   every   N
       days|weeks|months|quarters|years.

       All  of  these  will start on the first day of the requested period and
       end on the last one, as described above.

       Examples:

       -p "bimonthly  from  2008"  --  periods
       will  have  boundaries  on  2008/01/01,
       2008/03/01, ...
       -p "every 2 weeks" -- starts on closest
       preceeding Monday
       -p  "every 5 month from 2009/03" -- pe-
       riods   will   have    boundaries    on
       2009/03/01, 2009/08/01, ...

       If  you want intervals that start on arbitrary day of your choosing and
       span a week, month or year, you need to use any of the following:

       every Nth day of week, every <weekday>, every Nth day [of month], every
       Nth weekday [of month], every MM/DD [of year], every Nth MMM [of year],
       every MMM Nth [of year].

       Examples:

       -p "every 2nd day of week"  --  periods
       will go from Tue to Tue
       -p "every Tue" -- same
       -p  "every  15th  day" -- period bound-
       aries will be on 15th of each month
       -p "every 2nd Monday" -- period  bound-
       aries  will be on second Monday of each
       month

       -p "every 11/05" -- yearly periods with
       boundaries on 5th of Nov
       -p "every 5th Nov" -- same
       -p "every Nov 5th" -- same

       Show  historical balances at end of 15th each month (N is exclusive end
       date):

       hledger balance -H -p "every 16th day"

       Group postings from start of wednesday to end of  next  tuesday  (N  is
       start date and exclusive end date):

       hledger register checking -p "every 3rd day of week"

   Depth limiting
       With the --depth N option (short form: -N), commands like account, bal-
       ance and register will show only the uppermost accounts in the  account
       tree,  down to level N.  Use this when you want a summary with less de-
       tail.  This flag has the same effect as a depth: query argument (so -2,
       --depth=2 or depth:2 are basically equivalent).

   Pivoting
       Normally hledger sums amounts, and organizes them in a hierarchy, based
       on account name.  The --pivot FIELD option causes it to sum  and  orga-
       nize  hierarchy  based on the value of some other field instead.  FIELD
       can be: code, description, payee, note, or the full name (case insensi-
       tive) of any tag.  As with account names, values containing colon:sepa-
       rated:parts will be displayed hierarchically in reports.

       --pivot is a general option affecting all reports;  you  can  think  of
       hledger transforming the journal before any other processing, replacing
       every posting's account name with the value of the specified  field  on
       that posting, inheriting it from the transaction or using a blank value
       if it's not present.

       An example:

              2016/02/16 Member Fee Payment
                  assets:bank account                    2 EUR
                  income:member fees                    -2 EUR  ; member: John Doe

       Normal balance report showing account names:

              $ hledger balance
                             2 EUR  assets:bank account
                            -2 EUR  income:member fees
              --------------------
                                 0

       Pivoted balance report, using member: tag values instead:

              $ hledger balance --pivot member
                             2 EUR
                            -2 EUR  John Doe
              --------------------
                                 0

       One way to show only amounts with a member: value (using a  query,  de-
       scribed below):

              $ hledger balance --pivot member tag:member=.
                            -2 EUR  John Doe
              --------------------
                            -2 EUR

       Another  way  (the  acct:  query  matches  against the pivoted "account
       name"):

              $ hledger balance --pivot member acct:.
                            -2 EUR  John Doe
              --------------------
                            -2 EUR

   Valuation
   -B: Cost
       The -B/--cost flag converts amounts to their cost (or selling price) at
       transaction  time,  if  they  have a transaction price specified.  This
       flag is equivalent to --value=cost, described below.

   -V: Market value
       The -V/--market flag converts reported amounts to their market value in
       a  default  valuation commodity, using the market prices in effect on a
       default valuation date.  For single period reports, the valuation  date
       is  today  (equivalent  to --value=now); for multiperiod reports, it is
       the last day of each subperiod (equivalent to --value=end).

       The default valuation commodity is the one referenced in the latest ap-
       plicable  market  price dated on or before the valuation date.  If most
       of your P declarations lead to a single home currency, this  will  usu-
       ally be what you want.  (To specify the commodity, see -X below.)

       Note that in hledger, market prices are always declared explicitly with
       P directives; we do not infer them from transaction  prices  as  Ledger
       does.

       Here's a quick example of -V:

              ; one euro is worth this many dollars from nov 1
              P 2016/11/01 EUR $1.10

              ; purchase some euros on nov 3
              2016/11/3
                  assets:euros        EUR100
                  assets:checking

              ; the euro is worth fewer dollars by dec 21
              P 2016/12/21 EUR $1.03

       How many euros do I have ?

              $ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros
                              EUR100  assets:euros

       What are they worth at end of nov 3 ?

              $ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V -e 2016/11/4
                           $110.00  assets:euros

       What  are they worth after 2016/12/21 ?  (no report end date specified,
       defaults to today)

              $ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V
                           $103.00  assets:euros

   -X: Market value in specified commodity
       The -X/--exchange option is like -V, except  it  specifies  the  target
       commodity   you  would  like  to  convert  to.   It  is  equivalent  to
       --value=now,COMM or --value=end,COMM.

   --value: Flexible valuation
       (experimental, added 201905)

       -B, -V and -X are special cases of the more general --value option:

               --value=TYPE[,COMM]  TYPE is cost, end, now or YYYY-MM-DD.
                                    COMM is an optional commodity symbol.
                                    Shows amounts converted to:
                                    - cost commodity using transaction prices (then optionally to COMM using market prices at period end(s))
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at period end(s)
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using current market prices
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at some date

       The TYPE part basically selects either "cost", or "market value" plus a
       valuation date:

       --value=cost
              Convert  amounts  to cost, using the prices recorded in transac-
              tions.

       --value=end
              Convert amounts to their value in a default valuation commodity,
              using  market prices on the last day of the report period (or if
              unspecified, the journal's end date); or in multiperiod reports,
              market prices on the last day of each subperiod.

       --value=now
              Convert  amounts  to  their value in default valuation commodity
              using current market prices (as of when report is generated).

       --value=YYYY-MM-DD
              Convert amounts to their value in  default  valuation  commodity
              using market prices on this date.

       The  default valuation commodity is the commodity mentioned in the most
       recent applicable market price declaration.  When all your price decla-
       rations  lead  to a single home currency, this will usually do what you
       want.

       To select a different valuation commodity, add the optional ,COMM part:
       a  comma,  then  the  target  commodity's symbol.  Eg: --value=now,EUR.
       hledger will do its best to convert amounts to this commodity, using:

       o declared prices (from source commodity to valuation commodity)

       o reverse prices (declared prices from valuation to  source  commodity,
         inverted)

       o indirect  prices  (prices  calculated  from the shortest chain of de-
         clared or reverse prices from source to valuation commodity)

       in that order.

       Here are some examples showing the  effect  of  --value  as  seen  with
       print:

              P 2000-01-01 A  1 B
              P 2000-02-01 A  2 B
              P 2000-03-01 A  3 B
              P 2000-04-01 A  4 B

              2000-01-01
                (a)      1 A @ 5 B

              2000-02-01

              2000-03-01
                (a)      1 A @ 7 B

       Show the cost of each posting:

              $ hledger -f- print --value=cost
              2000/01/01
                  (a)             5 B

              2000/02/01
                  (a)             6 B

              2000/03/01
                  (a)             7 B

       Show the value as of the last day of the report period (2000-02-29):

              $ hledger -f- print --value=end date:2000/01-2000/03
              2000-01-01
                  (a)             2 B

              2000-02-01
                  (a)             2 B

       With  no  report  period specified, that shows the value as of the last
       day of the journal (2000-03-01):

              $ hledger -f- print --value=end
              2000/01/01
                  (a)             3 B

              2000/02/01
                  (a)             3 B

              2000/03/01
                  (a)             3 B

       Show the current value (the 2000-04-01 price is still in effect today):

              $ hledger -f- print --value=now
              2000-01-01
                  (a)             4 B

              2000-02-01
                  (a)             4 B

              2000-03-01
                  (a)             4 B

       Show the value on 2000/01/15:

              $ hledger -f- print --value=2000-01-15
              2000/01/01
                  (a)             1 B

              2000/02/01
                  (a)             1 B

              2000/03/01
                  (a)             1 B

       You may need to explicitly set a commodity's display  style,  when  re-
       verse prices are used.  Eg this output might be surprising:

              P 2000-01-01 A 2B

              2000-01-01
                a  1B
                b

              $ hledger print -x -X A
              2000/01/01
                  a               0
                  b               0

       Explanation:  because there's no amount or commodity directive specify-
       ing a display style for A, 0.5A gets the default style, which shows  no
       decimal digits.  Because the displayed amount looks like zero, the com-
       modity symbol and minus sign are not displayed either.  Adding  a  com-
       modity directive sets a more useful display style for A:

              P 2000-01-01 A 2B
              commodity 0.00A

              2000-01-01
                a  1B
                b

              $ hledger print -X A
              2000/01/01
                  a           0.50A
                  b          -0.50A

   Effect of --value on reports
       Here  is  a  reference  for  how --value currently affects each part of
       hledger's reports.  It's work in progress, but may be useful for  trou-

       Additional notes

       cost   calculated using price(s) recorded in the transaction(s).

       value  market value using available market price declarations,  or  the
              unchanged amount if no conversion rate can be found.

       report start
              the  first  day  of the report period specified with -b or -p or
              date:, otherwise today.

       report or journal start
              the first day of the report period specified with -b  or  -p  or
              date:,  otherwise  the earliest transaction date in the journal,
              otherwise today.

       report end
              the last day of the report period specified with  -e  or  -p  or
              date:, otherwise today.

       report or journal end
              the  last  day  of  the report period specified with -e or -p or
              date:, otherwise the latest transaction  date  in  the  journal,
              otherwise today.

       report interval
              a  flag (-D/-W/-M/-Q/-Y) or period expression that activates the
              report's multi-period mode (whether showing one or many subperi-
              ods).

   Combining -B, -V, -X, --value
       The rightmost of these flags wins.

   Output destination
       Some  commands (print, register, stats, the balance commands) can write
       their output to a destination other than the  console.   This  is  con-
       trolled by the -o/--output-file option.

              $ hledger balance -o -     # write to stdout (the default)
              $ hledger balance -o FILE  # write to FILE

   Output format
       Some  commands  can  write their output in other formats.  Eg print and
       register can output CSV, and the balance commands  can  output  CSV  or
       HTML.  This is controlled by the -O/--output-format option, or by spec-
       ifying a .csv or .html file extension with -o/--output-file.

              $ hledger balance -O csv       # write CSV to stdout
              $ hledger balance -o FILE.csv  # write CSV to FILE.csv

   Regular expressions
       hledger uses regular expressions in a number of places:

       o query terms, on the command line and in the hledger-web search  form:
         REGEX, desc:REGEX, cur:REGEX, tag:...=REGEX

       o CSV rules conditional blocks: if REGEX ...

       o account  alias  directives  and options: alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT,
         --alias /REGEX/=REPLACEMENT

       hledger's regular expressions come from  the  regex-tdfa  library.   In
       general they:

       o are case insensitive

       o are  infix  matching  (do  not  need  to match the entire thing being
         matched)

       o are POSIX extended regular expressions

       o also support GNU word boundaries (\<, \>, \b, \B)

       o and parenthesised capturing groups and numeric backreferences in  re-
         placement strings

       o do not support mode modifiers like (?s)

       Some things to note:

       o In  the  alias directive and --alias option, regular expressions must
         be enclosed in forward  slashes  (/REGEX/).   Elsewhere  in  hledger,
         these are not required.

       o In  queries,  to match a regular expression metacharacter like $ as a
         literal character, prepend a backslash.  Eg  to  search  for  amounts
         with the dollar sign in hledger-web, write cur:\$.

       o On  the command line, some metacharacters like $ have a special mean-
         ing to the shell and so must be escaped at least once more.  See Spe-
         cial characters.

QUERIES
       One  of  hledger's strengths is being able to quickly report on precise
       subsets of your data.  Most commands accept an optional  query  expres-
       sion,  written  as arguments after the command name, to filter the data
       by date, account name or other criteria.  The syntax is  similar  to  a
       web search: one or more space-separated search terms, quotes to enclose
       whitespace, prefixes to match specific fields, a not: prefix to  negate
       the match.

       We  do  not yet support arbitrary boolean combinations of search terms;
       instead most commands show transactions/postings/accounts  which  match
       (or negatively match):

       o any of the description terms AND

       o any of the account terms AND

       o any of the status terms AND

       o all the other terms.

       The print command instead shows transactions which:

       o match any of the description terms AND

       o have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND

       o have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND

       o match all the other terms.

       The  following  kinds  of search terms can be used.  Remember these can
       also be prefixed with not:, eg to exclude a particular subaccount.

       REGEX, acct:REGEX
              match account names by this regular expression.  (With  no  pre-
              fix, acct: is assumed.)  same as above

       amt:N, amt:<N, amt:<=N, amt:>N, amt:>=N
              match  postings with a single-commodity amount that is equal to,
              less than, or greater than N.  (Multi-commodity amounts are  not
              tested, and will always match.) The comparison has two modes: if
              N is preceded by a + or - sign (or is 0), the two signed numbers
              are  compared.  Otherwise, the absolute magnitudes are compared,
              ignoring sign.

       code:REGEX
              match by transaction code (eg check number)

       cur:REGEX
              match postings or transactions including any amounts whose  cur-
              rency/commodity  symbol  is fully matched by REGEX.  (For a par-
              tial match, use .*REGEX.*).  Note, to match characters which are
              regex-significant, like the dollar sign ($), you need to prepend
              \.  And when using the command line you need  to  add  one  more
              level  of  quoting  to hide it from the shell, so eg do: hledger
              print cur:'\$' or hledger print cur:\\$.

       desc:REGEX
              match transaction descriptions.

       date:PERIODEXPR
              match dates within the specified period.  PERIODEXPR is a period
              expression  (with  no  report  interval).   Examples: date:2016,
              date:thismonth,  date:2000/2/1-2/15,  date:lastweek-.   If   the
              --date2  command  line  flag  is present, this matches secondary
              dates instead.

       date2:PERIODEXPR
              match secondary dates within the specified period.

       depth:N
              match (or display, depending on command) accounts  at  or  above
              this depth

       note:REGEX
              match  transaction  notes  (part  of  description right of |, or
              whole description when there's no |)

       payee:REGEX
              match transaction payee/payer names (part of description left of
              |, or whole description when there's no |)

       real:, real:0
              match real or virtual postings respectively

       status:, status:!, status:*
              match unmarked, pending, or cleared transactions respectively

       tag:REGEX[=REGEX]
              match  by  tag  name,  and optionally also by tag value.  Note a
              tag: query is considered to match a transaction  if  it  matches
              any  of  the  postings.  Also remember that postings inherit the
              tags of their parent transaction.

       The following special search term is used automatically in hledger-web,
       only:

       inacct:ACCTNAME
              tells  hledger-web to show the transaction register for this ac-
              count.  Can be filtered further with acct etc.

       Some of these can also be expressed as command-line options (eg depth:2
       is  equivalent  to --depth 2).  Generally you can mix options and query
       arguments, and the resulting query will be their intersection  (perhaps
       excluding the -p/--period option).

COMMANDS
       hledger  provides  a  number  of subcommands; hledger with no arguments
       shows a list.

       If you install additional hledger-* packages, or if you put programs or
       scripts  named  hledger-NAME in your PATH, these will also be listed as
       subcommands.

       Run a subcommand by writing its name as first argument (eg hledger  in-
       comestatement).   You  can also write one of the standard short aliases
       displayed in parentheses in the command list (hledger b),  or  any  any
       unambiguous prefix of a command name (hledger inc).

       Here  are  all  the  builtin  commands in alphabetical order.  See also
       hledger for a more organised command list, and hledger CMD -h  for  de-
       tailed command help.

   accounts
       accounts, a
       Show account names.

       This  command  lists account names, either declared with account direc-
       tives (--declared), posted to (--used), or both  (the  default).   With
       query  arguments,  only  matched account names and account names refer-
       enced by matched postings are shown.  It shows a flat list by  default.
       With  --tree,  it  uses  indentation to show the account hierarchy.  In
       flat mode you can add --drop N to omit the first few account name  com-
       ponents.   Account names can be depth-clipped with depth:N or --depth N
       or -N.

       Examples:

              $ hledger accounts
              assets:bank:checking
              assets:bank:saving
              assets:cash
              expenses:food
              expenses:supplies
              income:gifts
              income:salary
              liabilities:debts

   activity
       activity
       Show an ascii barchart of posting counts per interval.

       The activity command displays an ascii  histogram  showing  transaction
       counts  by  day, week, month or other reporting interval (by day is the
       default).  With query arguments, it counts only matched transactions.

       Examples:

              $ hledger activity --quarterly
              2008-01-01 **
              2008-04-01 *******
              2008-07-01
              2008-10-01 **

   add
       add
       Prompt for transactions and add them to the journal.

       Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor,  or
       generate  them from CSV.  For more interactive data entry, there is the
       add command, which prompts interactively on the console for new  trans-
       actions, and appends them to the journal file (if there are multiple -f
       FILE options, the first file is used.) Existing  transactions  are  not
       changed.   This  is the only hledger command that writes to the journal
       file.

       To use it, just run hledger add and follow the prompts.  You can add as
       many  transactions as you like; when you are finished, enter . or press
       control-d or control-c to exit.

       Features:

       o add tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar (by  de-
         scription)  recent  transaction  (filtered by the query, if any) as a
         template.

       o You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.

       o Readline-style edit keys can be used during data entry.

       o The tab key will auto-complete whenever possible - accounts, descrip-
         tions,  dates  (yesterday,  today,  tomorrow).   If the input area is
         empty, it will insert the default value.

       o If the journal defines a default commodity, it will be added  to  any
         bare numbers entered.

       o A parenthesised transaction code may be entered following a date.

       o Comments and tags may be entered following a description or amount.

       o If  you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to restart the transac-
         tion.

       o Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when  the  terminal
         supports it.

       Example (see the tutorial for a detailed explanation):

              $ hledger add
              Adding transactions to journal file /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
              Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
              Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
              An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
              An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
              If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to restart the transaction.
              To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
              To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control-d or control-c.
              Date [2015/05/22]:
              Description: supermarket
              Account 1: expenses:food
              Amount  1: $10
              Account 2: assets:checking
              Amount  2 [$-10.0]:
              Account 3 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
              2015/05/22 supermarket
                  expenses:food             $10
                  assets:checking        $-10.0

              Save this transaction to the journal ? [y]:
              Saved.
              Starting the next transaction (. or ctrl-D/ctrl-C to quit)
              Date [2015/05/22]: <CTRL-D> $

       On  Microsoft  Windows,  the add command makes sure that no part of the
       file path ends with a period, as it can cause data loss on  that  plat-
       form (cf #1056).

   balance
       balance, bal, b
       Show accounts and their balances.

       The balance command is hledger's most versatile command.  Note, despite
       the name, it is not always used for  showing  real-world  account  bal-
       ances;  the  more accounting-aware balancesheet and incomestatement may
       be more convenient for that.

       By default, it displays all accounts, and each account's change in bal-
       ance during the entire period of the journal.  Balance changes are cal-
       culated by adding up the postings in each account.  You can  limit  the
       postings  matched,  by  a  query, to see fewer accounts, changes over a
       different time period, changes from only cleared transactions, etc.

       If you include an account's complete history of postings in the report,
       the  balance  change is equivalent to the account's current ending bal-
       ance.  For a real-world account, typically you won't have all  transac-
       tions in the journal; instead you'll have all transactions after a cer-
       tain date, and an "opening balances" transaction  setting  the  correct
       starting  balance  on  that  date.   Then the balance command will show
       real-world account balances.  In some cases the -H/--historical flag is
       used to ensure this (more below).

       The balance command can produce several styles of report:

   Classic balance report
       This  is  the  original balance report, as found in Ledger.  It usually
       looks like this:

              $ hledger balance
                               $-1  assets

       By default, accounts are displayed hierarchically, with subaccounts in-
       dented  below  their  parent.   At each level of the tree, accounts are
       sorted by  account  code  if  any,  then  by  account  name.   Or  with
       -S/--sort-amount, by their balance amount.

       "Boring" accounts, which contain a single interesting subaccount and no
       balance of their own, are elided into the following line for more  com-
       pact  output.  (Eg above, the "liabilities" account.) Use --no-elide to
       prevent this.

       Account balances are "inclusive" - they include  the  balances  of  any
       subaccounts.

       Accounts  which  have  zero  balance  (and no non-zero subaccounts) are
       omitted.  Use -E/--empty to show them.

       A final total is displayed by default; use  -N/--no-total  to  suppress
       it, eg:

              $ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses --no-total
                                $2  expenses
                                $1    food
                                $1    supplies

   Customising the classic balance report
       You  can  customise the layout of classic balance reports with --format
       FMT:

              $ hledger balance --format "%20(account) %12(total)"
                            assets          $-1
                       bank:saving           $1
                              cash          $-2
                          expenses           $2
                              food           $1
                          supplies           $1
                            income          $-2
                             gifts          $-1
                            salary          $-1
                 liabilities:debts           $1
              ---------------------------------
                                              0

       The FMT format string (plus a newline) specifies the formatting applied
       to  each  account/balance pair.  It may contain any suitable text, with
       data fields interpolated like so:

       %[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)

       o MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)

       o MAX truncates at this width (optional)

       o FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:

         o depth_spacer - a number of spaces equal to the account's depth,  or
           if MIN is specified, MIN * depth spaces.

         o account - the account's name

         o total - the account's balance/posted total, right justified

       Also,  FMT  can begin with an optional prefix to control how multi-com-
       modity amounts are rendered:

       o %_ - render on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)

       o %^ - render on multiple lines, top-aligned

       o %, - render on one line, comma-separated

       There are some quirks.  Eg in one-line mode, %(depth_spacer) has no ef-
       fect, instead %(account) has indentation built in.  Experimentation may
       be needed to get pleasing results.

       Some example formats:

       o %(total) - the account's total

       o %-20.20(account) - the account's name, left justified, padded  to  20
         characters and clipped at 20 characters

       o %,%-50(account)   %25(total)  - account name padded to 50 characters,
         total padded to 20 characters, with multiple commodities rendered  on
         one line

       o %20(total)   %2(depth_spacer)%-(account) - the default format for the
         single-column balance report

   Colour support
       The balance command shows negative amounts in red, if:

       o the TERM environment variable is not set to dumb

       o the output is not being redirected or piped anywhere

   Flat mode
       To see a flat list instead of the  default  hierarchical  display,  use
       --flat.   In this mode, accounts (unless depth-clipped) show their full
       names and "exclusive" balance, excluding any subaccount  balances.   In
       this mode, you can also use --drop N to omit the first few account name
       components.

              $ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses -N --flat --drop 1
                                $1  food
                                $1  supplies

   Depth limited balance reports
       With --depth N or depth:N or just -N,  balance  reports  show  accounts
       only  to the specified numeric depth.  This is very useful to summarise
       a complex set of accounts and get an overview.

              $ hledger balance -N -1
                               $-1  assets
                                $2  expenses
                               $-2  income
                                $1  liabilities

       Flat-mode balance reports, which normally show exclusive balances, show
       inclusive balances at the depth limit.

   Multicolumn balance report
       Multicolumn  or  tabular balance reports are a very useful hledger fea-
       ture, and usually the preferred style.  They share many  of  the  above
       features,  but they show the report as a table, with columns represent-
       ing time periods.  This mode is activated by providing a reporting  in-
       terval.

       There  are three types of multicolumn balance report, showing different
       information:

       1. By default: each column shows the sum of postings in that period, ie
          the  account's  change of balance in that period.  This is useful eg
          for a monthly income statement:

                  $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E
                  Balance changes in 2008:

                                     ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4
                  ===================++=================================
                   expenses:food     ||       0      $1       0       0
                   expenses:supplies ||       0      $1       0       0
                   income:gifts      ||       0     $-1       0       0
                   income:salary     ||     $-1       0       0       0
                  -------------------++---------------------------------
                                     ||     $-1      $1       0       0

       2. With --cumulative: each column shows the ending balance for that pe-
          riod,  accumulating  the  changes across periods, starting from 0 at
          the report start date:

                  $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E --cumulative
                  Ending balances (cumulative) in 2008:

                                     ||  2008/03/31  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31
                  ===================++=================================================
                   expenses:food     ||           0          $1          $1          $1
                   expenses:supplies ||           0          $1          $1          $1
                   income:gifts      ||           0         $-1         $-1         $-1
                   income:salary     ||         $-1         $-1         $-1         $-1
                  -------------------++-------------------------------------------------
                                     ||         $-1           0           0           0

       3. With --historical/-H: each column shows the actual historical ending
          balance  for  that  period, accumulating the changes across periods,
          starting from the actual balance at the report start date.  This  is
          useful eg for a multi-period balance sheet, and when you are showing
          only the data after a certain start date:

                  $ hledger balance ^assets ^liabilities --quarterly --historical --begin 2008/4/1
                  Ending balances (historical) in 2008/04/01-2008/12/31:

                                        ||  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31
                  ======================++=====================================
                   assets:bank:checking ||          $1          $1           0
                   assets:bank:saving   ||          $1          $1          $1
                   assets:cash          ||         $-2         $-2         $-2
                   liabilities:debts    ||           0           0          $1
                  ----------------------++-------------------------------------
                                        ||           0           0           0

       Note that --cumulative or --historical/-H disable --row-total/-T, since
       summing end balances generally does not make sense.

       Multicolumn  balance  reports display accounts in flat mode by default;
       to see the hierarchy, use --tree.

       With  a  reporting  interval  (like  --quarterly  above),  the   report
       start/end  dates  will  be adjusted if necessary so that they encompass
       the displayed report periods.  This is so that the first and last peri-
       ods will be "full" and comparable to the others.

       The  -E/--empty  flag  does  two things in multicolumn balance reports:
       first, the report will show all columns within the specified report pe-
       riod  (without -E, leading and trailing columns with all zeroes are not
       shown).  Second, all accounts which existed at the  report  start  date
       will  be  considered, not just the ones with activity during the report
       period (use -E to include low-activity accounts which  would  otherwise
       would be omitted).

       The -T/--row-total flag adds an additional column showing the total for
       each row.

       The -A/--average flag adds a column showing the average value  in  each
       row.

       Here's an example of all three:

              $ hledger balance -Q income expenses --tree -ETA
              Balance changes in 2008:

                          ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4    Total  Average
              ============++===================================================
               expenses   ||       0      $2       0       0       $2       $1
                 food     ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0
                 supplies ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0
               income     ||     $-1     $-1       0       0      $-2      $-1
                 gifts    ||       0     $-1       0       0      $-1        0
                 salary   ||     $-1       0       0       0      $-1        0
              ------------++---------------------------------------------------
                          ||     $-1      $1       0       0        0        0

              # Average is rounded to the dollar here since all journal amounts are

       Limitations:

       In multicolumn reports the -V/--value flag uses the market price on the
       report end date, for all columns (not the price on  each  column's  end
       date).

       Eliding  of boring parent accounts in tree mode, as in the classic bal-
       ance report, is not yet supported in multicolumn reports.

   Budget report
       With --budget, extra columns are displayed  showing  budget  goals  for
       each  account and period, if any.  Budget goals are defined by periodic
       transactions.  This is very useful for comparing planned and actual in-
       come,  expenses, time usage, etc.  --budget is most often combined with
       a report interval.

       For example, you can take average monthly expenses in  the  common  ex-
       pense categories to construct a minimal monthly budget:

              ;; Budget
              ~ monthly
                income  $2000
                expenses:food    $400
                expenses:bus     $50
                expenses:movies  $30
                assets:bank:checking

              ;; Two months worth of expenses
              2017-11-01
                income  $1950
                expenses:food    $396
                expenses:bus     $49
                expenses:movies  $30
                expenses:supplies  $20
                assets:bank:checking

              2017-12-01
                income  $2100
                expenses:food    $412
                expenses:bus     $53
                expenses:gifts   $100
                assets:bank:checking

       You can now see a monthly budget report:

              $ hledger balance -M --budget

       Note this is different from a normal balance report in several ways:

       o Only  accounts  with budget goals during the report period are shown,
         by default.

       o In each column, in square brackets after the actual amount,  budgeted
         amounts are shown, along with the percentage of budget used.

       o All  parent accounts are always shown, even in flat mode.  Eg assets,
         assets:bank, and expenses above.

       o Amounts always include all subaccounts, budgeted or unbudgeted,  even
         in flat mode.

       This means that the numbers displayed will not always add up! Eg above,
       the expenses actual amount includes the  gifts  and  supplies  transac-
       tions,  but  the  expenses:gifts and expenses:supplies accounts are not
       shown, as they have no budget amounts declared.

       This can be confusing.  When you need to make things clearer,  use  the
       -E/--empty  flag,  which  will reveal all accounts including unbudgeted
       ones, giving the full picture.  Eg:

              $ hledger balance -M --budget --empty

   Nested budgets
       You can add budgets to any account in your account hierarchy.   If  you
       have budgets on both parent account and some of its children, then bud-
       get(s) of the child account(s) would be added to the  budget  of  their
       parent, much like account balances behave.

       In  the  most  simple case this means that once you add a budget to any
       account, all its parents would have budget as well.

       To illustrate this, consider the following budget:

              ~ monthly from 2019/01
                  expenses:personal             $1,000.00
                  expenses:personal:electronics    $100.00
                  liabilities

       With this, monthly budget for electronics is defined  to  be  $100  and
       budget  for  personal  expenses is an additional $1000, which implicity
       means that budget for both expenses:personal and expenses is $1100.

       Transactions in expenses:personal:electronics will be counted both  to-
       wards its $100 budget and $1100 of expenses:personal , and transactions
       in any other subaccount of expenses:personal would be  counted  towards
       only towards the budget of expenses:personal.

       For example, let's consider these transactions:

              ~ monthly from 2019/01
                  expenses:personal             $1,000.00
                  expenses:personal:electronics    $100.00
                  liabilities

              2019/01/01 Google home hub
                  expenses:personal:electronics          $90.00
                  liabilities                           $-90.00

              2019/01/02 Phone screen protector
                  expenses:personal:electronics:upgrades          $10.00
                  liabilities

              2019/01/02 Weekly train ticket
                  expenses:personal:train tickets       $153.00
                  liabilities

              2019/01/03 Flowers
                  expenses:personal          $30.00
                  liabilities

       As  you  can  see,  we have transactions in expenses:personal:electron-
       ics:upgrades and expenses:personal:train tickets,  and  since  both  of
       these  accounts  are  without explicitly defined budget, these transac-
       tions would be counted towards budgets of expenses:personal:electronics
       and expenses:personal accordingly:

   Output format
       The balance command supports output destination and output  format  se-
       lection.

   balancesheet
       balancesheet, bs
       This command displays a simple balance sheet, showing historical ending
       balances of asset and liability accounts  (ignoring  any  report  begin
       date).   It  assumes that these accounts are under a top-level asset or
       liability account (case insensitive, plural forms also allowed).

       Note this report shows all account balances with normal  positive  sign
       (like conventional financial statements, unlike balance/print/register)
       (experimental).

       Example:

              $ hledger balancesheet
              Balance Sheet

              Assets:
                               $-1  assets
                                $1    bank:saving
                               $-2    cash
              --------------------
                               $-1

              Liabilities:
                                $1  liabilities:debts
              --------------------
                                $1

              Total:
              --------------------
                                 0

       With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
       report  period.  As with multicolumn balance reports, you can alter the
       report mode  with  --change/--cumulative/--historical.   Normally  bal-
       ancesheet  shows historical ending balances, which is what you need for
       a balance sheet; note this means it ignores  report  begin  dates  (and
       -T/--row-total,  since  summing  end  balances  generally does not make
       sense).

       This command also supports output destination and output format  selec-
       tion.

   balancesheetequity
       balancesheetequity, bse
       Just  like  balancesheet,  but also reports Equity (which it assumes is
       under a top-level equity account).

       Example:

              $ hledger balancesheetequity
              Balance Sheet With Equity

              Assets:
                               $-2  assets
                                $1    bank:saving
                               $-3    cash
              --------------------
                               $-2

              Liabilities:
                                $1  liabilities:debts
              --------------------
                                $1

              Equity:
                        $1  equity:owner
              --------------------
                        $1

              Total:
              --------------------
                                 0

   cashflow
       cashflow, cf
       This command displays a simple cashflow statement, showing  changes  in
       "cash"  accounts.  It assumes that these accounts are under a top-level
       asset account (case insensitive, plural forms also allowed) and do  not
       contain  receivable  or  A/R in their name.  Note this report shows all
       account balances with normal positive sign (like conventional financial
       statements, unlike balance/print/register) (experimental).

       Example:

              $ hledger cashflow
              Cashflow Statement

              Cash flows:
                               $-1  assets
                                $1    bank:saving
                               $-2    cash
              --------------------
                               $-1

              Total:
              --------------------
                               $-1

       With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
       report period.  Normally cashflow shows changes in assets  per  period,
       though  as  with  multicolumn  balance reports you can alter the report
       mode with --change/--cumulative/--historical.

       This command also supports output destination and output format  selec-
       tion.

   check-dates
       check-dates
       Check  that  transactions are sorted by increasing date.  With --date2,
       checks secondary dates instead.  With  --strict,  dates  must  also  be
       unique.   With  a  query, only matched transactions' dates are checked.
       Reads the default journal file, or another specified with -f.

   check-dupes
       check-dupes
       Reports account names having the same leaf but different prefixes.   In
       other  words,  two  or  more  leaves  that are categorized differently.
       Reads the default journal file, or another specified as an argument.

       An example: http://stefanorodighiero.net/software/hledger-dupes.html

   close
       close, equity
       Prints a "closing  balances"  transaction  and  an  "opening  balances"
       transaction that bring account balances to and from zero, respectively.
       Useful for bringing asset/liability balances forward into a new journal
       file,  or for closing out revenues/expenses to retained earnings at the
       end of a period.

       The closing transaction  transfers  balances  to  "equity:closing  bal-
       ances".   The opening transaction transfers balances from "equity:open-
       ing balances".  You can choose to print just one of the transactions by
       using the --opening or --closing flag.

       If you split your journal files by time (eg yearly), you will typically
       run this command at the end of the year, and save the closing  transac-
       tion  as last entry of the old file, and the opening transaction as the
       first entry of the new file.  This makes the files self  contained,  so
       that  correct balances are reported no matter which of them are loaded.
       Ie, if you load just one file, the balances are initialised  correctly;
       or  if  you  load several files, the redundant closing/opening transac-
       tions cancel each other out.  (They will show up in print  or  register
       reports;  you  can  exclude  them  with  a  query like not:desc:'(open-
       ing|closing) balances'.)

       If you're running a business, you might also use this command to "close
       the  books"  at  the  end  of an accounting period, transferring income
       statement account balances to retained  earnings.   (You  may  want  to
       change the equity account name to something like "equity:retained earn-
       ings".)

       By default, the closing transaction is dated  yesterday,  the  balances
       are  calculated  as of end of yesterday, and the opening transaction is
       dated today.  To close on some other date, use: hledger close -e  OPEN-
       INGDATE.   Eg,  to  close/open  on the 2018/2019 boundary, use -e 2019.
       You can also use -p or date:PERIOD (any starting date is ignored).

       Both transactions will include balance assertions  for  the  closed/re-
       opened accounts.  You probably shouldn't use status or realness filters
       (like -C or -R or status:) with this command, or the generated  balance
       assertions  will depend on these flags.  Likewise, if you run this com-
       mand with --auto, the balance assertions will probably  always  require
       --auto.

       When  account  balances have cost information (transaction prices), the
       closing/opening transactions will preserve it, so that  eg  balance  -B
       reports will not be affected.

       Examples:

       Carrying  asset/liability  balances  into a new file for 2019, all from
       command line:

       Warning: we use >> here to append; be careful not to type  a  single  >
       which would wipe your journal!

              $ hledger close -f 2018.journal -e 2019 assets liabilities --opening >>2019.journal
              $ hledger close -f 2018.journal -e 2019 assets liabilities --closing >>2018.journal

       Now:

              $ hledger bs -f 2019.journal                   # one file - balances are correct
              $ hledger bs -f 2018.journal -f 2019.journal   # two files - balances still correct
              $ hledger bs -f 2018.journal not:desc:closing  # to see year-end balances, must exclude closing txn

       Transactions spanning the closing date can complicate matters, breaking
       balance assertions:

              2018/12/30 a purchase made in 2018, clearing the following year
                  expenses:food          5
                  assets:bank:checking  -5  ; [2019/1/2]

       Here's one way to resolve that:

              ; in 2018.journal:
              2018/12/30 a purchase made in 2018, clearing the following year
                  expenses:food          5
                  liabilities:pending

              ; in 2019.journal:
              2019/1/2 clearance of last year's pending transactions
                  liabilities:pending    5 = 0
                  assets:checking

   commodities
       commodities
       List all commodity/currency symbols used or declared in the journal.

   descriptions
       descriptions Show descriptions.

       This command lists all descriptions that appear in transactions.

       Examples:

              $ hledger descriptions
              Store Name
              Gas Station | Petrol
              Person A

   diff
       diff
       Compares a particular account's transactions in two  input  files.   It
       shows any transactions to this account which are in one file but not in
       the other.

       More precisely, for each posting affecting this account in either file,
       it  looks for a corresponding posting in the other file which posts the
       same amount to the same  account  (ignoring  date,  description,  etc.)
       Since postings not transactions are compared, this also works when mul-
       tiple bank transactions have been combined into a single journal entry.

       This is useful eg if you have downloaded an account's transactions from
       your  bank (eg as CSV data).  When hledger and your bank disagree about
       the account balance, you can compare the bank data with your journal to
       find out the cause.

       Examples:

              $ hledger diff -f $LEDGER_FILE -f bank.csv assets:bank:giro
              These transactions are in the first file only:

              2014/01/01 Opening Balances
                  assets:bank:giro              EUR ...
                  ...
                  equity:opening balances       EUR -...

              These transactions are in the second file only:

   files
       files
       List  all  files  included in the journal.  With a REGEX argument, only
       file names matching the regular expression (case sensitive) are shown.

   help
       help
       Show any of the hledger manuals.

       The help command displays any of the main hledger manuals,  in  one  of
       several  ways.  Run it with no argument to list the manuals, or provide
       a full or partial manual name to select one.

       hledger manuals are available in several formats.   hledger  help  will
       use  the  first  of  these  display  methods  that it finds: info, man,
       $PAGER, less, stdout (or when non-interactive, just stdout).   You  can
       force a particular viewer with the --info, --man, --pager, --cat flags.

       Examples:

              $ hledger help
              Please choose a manual by typing "hledger help MANUAL" (a substring is ok).

              NAME
                     hledger - a command-line accounting tool

              SYNOPSIS
                     hledger [-f FILE] COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]
                     hledger [-f FILE] ADDONCMD -- [OPTIONS] [ARGS]
                     hledger

              DESCRIPTION
                     hledger  is  a  cross-platform  program  for tracking money, time, or any
              ...

   import
       import
       Read  new  transactions added to each FILE since last run, and add them
       to the main journal file.  Or with --dry-run, just print  the  transac-
       tions  that  would  be  added.  Or with --catchup, just mark all of the
       FILEs' transactions as imported, without actually importing any.

       The input files are specified as arguments - no need to write -f before
       each one.  So eg to add new transactions from all CSV files to the main
       journal, it's just: hledger import *.csv

       New transactions are detected in the same way as print --new: by assum-
       ing transactions are always added to the input files in increasing date
       order, and by saving .latest.FILE state files.

       The --dry-run output is in journal format, so you can filter it, eg  to
       see only uncategorised transactions:

              $ hledger import --dry ... | hledger -f- print unknown --ignore-assertions

   Importing balance assignments
       Entries  added  by import will have their posting amounts made explicit
       (like hledger print -x).  This means that any  balance  assignments  in
       imported  files must be evaluated; but, imported files don't get to see
       the main file's account balances.  As a result, importing entries  with
       balance assignments (eg from an institution that provides only balances
       and not posting  amounts)  will  probably  generate  incorrect  posting
       amounts.  To avoid this problem, use print instead of import:

              $ hledger print IMPORTFILE [--new] >> $LEDGER_FILE

       (If  you  think  import  should leave amounts implicit like print does,
       please test it and send a pull request.)

   incomestatement
       incomestatement, is
       This command displays a simple income statement, showing  revenues  and
       expenses  during  a period.  It assumes that these accounts are under a
       top-level revenue or income or expense account (case insensitive,  plu-
       ral  forms  also allowed).  Note this report shows all account balances
       with normal positive sign (like conventional financial statements,  un-
       like balance/print/register) (experimental).

       This  command displays a simple income statement.  It currently assumes
       that you have top-level accounts named income (or revenue) and  expense
       (plural forms also allowed.)

              $ hledger incomestatement
              Income Statement

              Revenues:
                               $-2  income
                               $-1    gifts
                               $-1    salary
              --------------------
                               $-2

              Expenses:
                                $2  expenses
                                $1    food
                                $1    supplies
              --------------------
                                $2

              Total:
              --------------------
                                 0

       With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
       report period.  Normally incomestatement  shows  revenues/expenses  per
       period,  though  as  with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the
       report mode with --change/--cumulative/--historical.

       This command also supports output destination and output format  selec-
       tion.

   notes
       notes Show notes.

       This command lists all notes that appear in transactions.

       Examples:

              $ hledger notes
              Petrol
              Snacks

   payees
       payees Show payee names.

       This command lists all payee names that appear in transactions.

       Examples:

              $ hledger payees
              Store Name
              Gas Station
              Person A

   prices
       prices
       Print  market  price  directives  from the journal.  With --costs, also
       print synthetic market prices based on transaction prices.  With  --in-
       verted-costs,  also  print  inverse prices based on transaction prices.
       Prices (and postings providing prices) can  be  filtered  by  a  query.
       Price amounts are always displayed with their full precision.

   print
       print, txns, p
       Show transaction journal entries, sorted by date.

       The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from the
       journal file in date order, tidily formatted.  With  --date2,  transac-
       tions are sorted by secondary date instead.

       print's output is always a valid hledger journal.
       It  preserves all transaction information, but it does not preserve di-
       rectives or inter-transaction comments

              $ hledger print
              2008/01/01 income
                  assets:bank:checking            $1
                  income:salary                  $-1

              2008/06/01 gift
                  assets:bank:checking            $1
                  income:gifts                   $-1

              2008/06/02 save
                  assets:bank:saving              $1
                  assets:bank:checking           $-1

              2008/06/03 * eat & shop
                  expenses:food                $1
                  expenses:supplies            $1
                  assets:cash                 $-2

              2008/12/31 * pay off
                  liabilities:debts               $1
                  assets:bank:checking           $-1

       Normally, the journal entry's explicit or implicit amount style is pre-
       served.   Ie when an amount is omitted in the journal, it will be omit-
       ted in the output.  You can use the  -x/--explicit  flag  to  make  all
       amounts explicit, which can be useful for troubleshooting or for making
       your journal more readable and robust against data entry errors.  Note,
       -x  will  cause postings with a multi-commodity amount (these can arise
       when a multi-commodity transaction has  an  implicit  amount)  will  be
       split  into  multiple single-commodity postings, for valid journal out-
       put.

       With -B/--cost, amounts with transaction prices are converted  to  cost
       using that price.  This can be used for troubleshooting.

       With  -m/--match and a STR argument, print will show at most one trans-
       action: the one one whose description is most similar to  STR,  and  is
       most  recent.  STR should contain at least two characters.  If there is
       no similar-enough match, no transaction will be shown.

       With --new, for each FILE being read, hledger reads (and writes) a spe-
       cial  state  file  (.latest.FILE in the same directory), containing the
       latest transaction date(s) that were seen  last  time  FILE  was  read.
       When  this  file  is found, only transactions with newer dates (and new
       transactions on the latest date) are printed.  This is useful  for  ig-
       noring  already-seen  entries  in  import  data, such as downloaded CSV
       files.  Eg:

              $ hledger -f bank1.csv print --new
              # shows transactions added since last print --new on this file

       This assumes that transactions added to FILE always have  same  or  in-
       creasing  dates,  and  that transactions on the same day do not get re-
       ordered.  See also the import command.

       This command also supports output destination and output format  selec-
       tion.  Here's an example of print's CSV output:

              $ hledger print -Ocsv
              "txnidx","date","date2","status","code","description","comment","account","amount","commodity","credit","debit","posting-status","posting-comment"
              "1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
              "1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","income:salary","-1","$","1","","",""
              "2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
              "2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","income:gifts","-1","$","1","","",""
              "3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:saving","1","$","","1","",""
              "3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""
              "4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:food","1","$","","1","",""
              "4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:supplies","1","$","","1","",""
              "4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","assets:cash","-2","$","2","","",""
              "5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","liabilities:debts","1","$","","1","",""
              "5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""

       o There  is  one  CSV record per posting, with the parent transaction's
         fields repeated.

       o The "txnidx" (transaction index) field shows which postings belong to
         the  same transaction.  (This number might change if transactions are
         reordered within the file, files are parsed/included in  a  different
         order, etc.)

       o The  amount  is  separated into "commodity" (the symbol) and "amount"
         (numeric quantity) fields.

       o The numeric amount is repeated in either the "credit" or "debit" col-
         umn,  for convenience.  (Those names are not accurate in the account-
         ing sense; it just puts negative amounts under  credit  and  zero  or
         greater amounts under debit.)

   print-unique
       print-unique
       Print transactions which do not reuse an already-seen description.

       Example:

              $ cat unique.journal
              1/1 test
               (acct:one)  1
              2/2 test
               (acct:two)  2
              $ LEDGER_FILE=unique.journal hledger print-unique
              (-f option not supported)
              2015/01/01 test
                  (acct:one)             1

   register
       register, reg, r
       Show postings and their running total.

       The register command displays postings in date order, one per line, and
       their running total.  This is typically used with a query  selecting  a
       particular account, to see that account's activity:

              $ hledger register checking
              2008/01/01 income               assets:bank:checking            $1           $1
              2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
              2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
              2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0

       With --date2, it shows and sorts by secondary date instead.

       The  --historical/-H  flag  adds the balance from any undisplayed prior
       postings to the running total.  This is useful when  you  want  to  see
       only recent activity, with a historically accurate running balance:

              $ hledger register checking -b 2008/6 --historical
              2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
              2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
              2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0

       The --depth option limits the amount of sub-account detail displayed.

       The  --average/-A flag shows the running average posting amount instead
       of the running total (so, the final number displayed is the average for
       the  whole  report period).  This flag implies --empty (see below).  It
       is affected by --historical.  It works best when showing just  one  ac-
       count and one commodity.

       The  --related/-r  flag shows the other postings in the transactions of
       the postings which would normally be shown.

       The --invert flag negates all amounts.  For example, it can be used  on
       an income account where amounts are normally displayed as negative num-
       bers.  It's also useful to show postings on the  checking  account  to-
       gether with the related account:

              $ hledger register --related --invert assets:checking

       With a reporting interval, register shows summary postings, one per in-
       terval, aggregating the postings to each account:

              $ hledger register --monthly income
              2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
              2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2

       Periods with no activity, and summary postings with a zero amount,  are
       not shown by default; use the --empty/-E flag to see them:

              $ hledger register --monthly income -E
              2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
              2008/02                                                          0          $-1
              2008/03                                                          0          $-1
              2008/04                                                          0          $-1
              2008/05                                                          0          $-1
              2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2
              2008/07                                                          0          $-2
              2008/08                                                          0          $-2
              2008/09                                                          0          $-2
              2008/10                                                          0          $-2
              2008/11                                                          0          $-2
              2008/12                                                          0          $-2

       Often,  you'll want to see just one line per interval.  The --depth op-
       tion helps with this, causing subaccounts to be aggregated:

              $ hledger register --monthly assets --depth 1h
              2008/01                 assets                                  $1           $1
              2008/06                 assets                                 $-1            0
              2008/12                 assets                                 $-1          $-1

       Note when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates  these
       will  be adjusted outward if necessary to contain a whole number of in-
       tervals.  This ensures that the  first  and  last  intervals  are  full
       length and comparable to the others in the report.

   Custom register output
       register  uses  the  full terminal width by default, except on windows.
       You can override this by setting the COLUMNS environment variable  (not
       a bash shell variable) or by using the --width/-w option.

       The  description  and  account columns normally share the space equally
       (about half of (width - 40) each).  You can adjust this by adding a de-
       scription width as part of --width's argument, comma-separated: --width
       W,D .  Here's a diagram (won't display correctly in --help):

              <--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
              date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
              DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA

       and some examples:

              $ hledger reg                     # use terminal width (or 80 on windows)
              $ hledger reg -w 100              # use width 100
              $ COLUMNS=100 hledger reg         # set with one-time environment variable
              $ export COLUMNS=100; hledger reg # set till session end (or window resize)
              $ hledger reg -w 100,40           # set overall width 100, description width 40
              $ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,40      # use terminal width, & description width 40

       This command also supports output destination and output format  selec-
       tion.

   register-match
       register-match
       Print the one posting whose transaction description is closest to DESC,
       in the style of the register command.  If there  are  multiple  equally
       good  matches,  it  shows the most recent.  Query options (options, not
       arguments) can be used to restrict the search space.  Helps  ledger-au-
       tosync detect already-seen transactions when importing.

   rewrite
       rewrite
       Print all transactions, rewriting the postings of matched transactions.
       For now the only rewrite available is adding new postings,  like  print
       --auto.

       This is a start at a generic rewriter of transaction entries.  It reads
       the default journal and prints the transactions, like print,  but  adds
       one or more specified postings to any transactions matching QUERY.  The
       posting amounts can be fixed, or a multiplier of the existing  transac-
       tion's first posting amount.

       Examples:

              $ hledger-rewrite.hs ^income --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33  ; income tax' --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  $100'
              $ hledger-rewrite.hs expenses:gifts --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  *-1"'
              $ hledger-rewrite.hs -f rewrites.hledger

       rewrites.hledger may consist of entries like:

              = ^income amt:<0 date:2017
                (liabilities:tax)  *0.33  ; tax on income
                (reserve:grocery)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery
                (reserve:)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery

       Note  the  single  quotes to protect the dollar sign from bash, and the
       two spaces between account and amount.

       More:

              $ hledger rewrite -- [QUERY]        --add-posting "ACCT  AMTEXPR" ...
              $ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'
              $ hledger rewrite -- expenses:gifts --add-posting '(budget:gifts)  *-1"'
              $ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(budget:foreign currency)  *0.25 JPY; diversify'

       Argument for --add-posting option is a  usual  posting  of  transaction
       with  an  exception  for amount specification.  More precisely, you can
       use '*' (star symbol) before the amount to indicate that that this is a
       factor  for  an  amount of original matched posting.  If the amount in-
       cludes a commodity name, the new posting amount will be in the new com-
       modity;  otherwise,  it will be in the matched posting amount's commod-
       ity.

   Re-write rules in a file
       During the run this tool will execute  so  called  "Automated  Transac-
       tions" found in any journal it process.  I.e instead of specifying this
       operations in command line you can put them in a journal file.

              $ rewrite-rules.journal

       Make contents look like this:

              = ^income
                  (liabilities:tax)  *.33

              = expenses:gifts
                  budget:gifts  *-1
                  assets:budget  *1

       Note that '=' (equality symbol) that is used instead of date in  trans-
       actions you usually write.  It indicates the query by which you want to
       match the posting to add new ones.

              $ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal -f rewrite-rules.journal > rewritten-tidy-output.journal

       This is something similar to the commands pipeline:

              $ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33' \
                | hledger rewrite -- -f - expenses:gifts      --add-posting 'budget:gifts  *-1'       \
                                                              --add-posting 'assets:budget  *1'       \
                > rewritten-tidy-output.journal

       It is important to understand that relative order of  such  entries  in
       journal  is important.  You can re-use result of previously added post-
       ings.

   Diff output format
       To use this tool for batch modification of your journal files  you  may
       find useful output in form of unified diff.

              $ hledger rewrite -- --diff -f examples/sample.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'

       Output might look like:

              --- /tmp/examples/sample.journal
              +++ /tmp/examples/sample.journal

       If you'll pass this through patch tool you'll get transactions contain-
       ing the posting that matches your query be updated.  Note that multiple
       files  might  be  update according to list of input files specified via
       --file options and include directives inside of these files.

       Be careful.  Whole transaction being re-formatted in a style of  output
       from hledger print.

   rewrite vs. print --auto
       This  command  predates  print --auto, and currently does much the same
       thing, but with these differences:

       o with multiple files, rewrite lets rules in any file affect all  other
         files.   print  --auto  uses standard directive scoping; rules affect
         only child files.

       o rewrite's query limits which transactions can be rewritten;  all  are
         printed.  print --auto's query limits which transactions are printed.

       o rewrite  applies  rules  specified on command line or in the journal.
         print --auto applies rules specified in the journal.

   roi
       roi
       Shows the time-weighted (TWR) and money-weighted (IRR) rate  of  return
       on your investments.

       This  command  assumes  that  you have account(s) that hold nothing but
       your investments and whenever you record current appraisal/valuation of
       these investments you offset unrealized profit and loss into account(s)
       that, again, hold nothing but unrealized profit and loss.

       Any transactions affecting balance of  investment  account(s)  and  not
       originating  from  unrealized profit and loss account(s) are assumed to
       be your investments or withdrawals.

       At a minimum, you need to supply a query (which could be  just  an  ac-
       count name) to select your investments with --inv, and another query to
       identify your profit and loss transactions with --pnl.

       It will compute and display the internalized rate of return  (IRR)  and
       time-weighted  rate  of  return (TWR) for your investments for the time
       period requested.  Both rates of return are annualized before  display,
       regardless of the length of reporting interval.

   stats
       stats
       Show some journal statistics.

       The  stats  command displays summary information for the whole journal,
       or a matched part of it.  With a reporting interval, it shows a  report
       for each report period.

       Example:

              $ hledger stats
              Main journal file        : /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
              Included journal files   :
              Transactions span        : 2008-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (366 days)
              Last transaction         : 2008-12-31 (2333 days ago)
              Transactions             : 5 (0.0 per day)
              Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
              Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
              Payees/descriptions      : 5
              Accounts                 : 8 (depth 3)
              Commodities              : 1 ($)
              Market prices            : 12 ($)

       This  command also supports output destination and output format selec-
       tion.

   tags
       tags
       List all the tag names used in the journal.  With a TAGREGEX  argument,
       only  tag  names matching the regular expression (case insensitive) are
       shown.  With QUERY arguments, only transactions matching the query  are
       considered.  With --values flag, the tags' unique values are listed in-
       stead.

   test
       test
       Run built-in unit tests.

       This command runs the unit tests built in to hledger-lib  and  hledger,
       printing test names and results on stdout.  If any test fails, the exit
       code will be non-zero.

       Test names include a group prefix.  If a (exact, case sensitive)  group
       prefix,  or  a  full  test name is provided as the first argument, only
       that group or test is run.

       If a numeric second argument is provided, it will  set  the  randomness
       seed,  for  repeatable  results  from tests using randomness (currently
       none of them).

       This is mainly used by developers, but it's nice to be able to  sanity-
       check your installed hledger executable at any time.  All tests are ex-
       pected to pass - if you ever see otherwise, something has  gone  wrong,
       please report a bug!

ADD-ON COMMANDS
       hledger  also  searches  for external add-on commands, and will include
       these in the commands list.  These are programs or scripts in your PATH
       whose  name starts with hledger- and ends with a recognised file exten-
       sion (currently: no extension, bat,com,exe, hs,lhs,pl,py,rb,rkt,sh).

       Add-ons can be invoked like any hledger command, but there  are  a  few
       things to be aware of.  Eg if the hledger-web add-on is installed,

       o hledger  -h  web  shows  hledger's  help,  while hledger web -h shows
         hledger-web's help.

       o Flags specific to the add-on must have a preceding --  to  hide  them
         from  hledger.   So hledger web --serve --port 9000 will be rejected;
         you must use hledger web -- --serve --port 9000.

       o You can always run add-ons directly if preferred: hledger-web --serve
         --port 9000.

       Add-ons  are  a relatively easy way to add local features or experiment
       with new ideas.  They can be  written  in  any  language,  but  haskell
       scripts  have  a  big  advantage:  they  can  use the same hledger (and
       haskell) library functions that built-in commands do, for  command-line
       options, journal parsing, reporting, etc.

       Here are some hledger add-ons available:

   Official add-ons
       These are maintained and released along with hledger.

   ui
       hledger-ui provides an efficient terminal interface.

   web
       hledger-web provides a simple web interface.

   Third party add-ons
       These  are  maintained  separately, and usually updated shortly after a
       hledger release.

   diff
       hledger-diff shows differences in an account's transactions between one
       journal file and another.

   iadd
       hledger-iadd is a more interactive, terminal UI replacement for the add
       command.

   interest
       hledger-interest generates interest transactions for an account accord-
       ing to various schemes.

   irr
       hledger-irr calculates the internal rate of return of an investment ac-
       count, but it's superseded now by the built-in roi command.

   Experimental add-ons
       These are available in source form in the hledger  repo's  bin/  direc-
       tory.   They  may be less mature and documented than built-in commands.
       Reading and tweaking these is a good way to start making your own!

   autosync
       hledger-autosync is a symbolic link for easily running ledger-autosync,
       if  installed.   ledger-autosync  does  deduplicating conversion of OFX
       data and some CSV formats, and can also download the data if your  bank
       offers OFX Direct Connect.

   chart
       hledger-chart.hs is an old pie chart generator, in need of some love.

   check
       hledger-check.hs checks more powerful account balance assertions.

ENVIRONMENT
       COLUMNS  The  screen  width used by the register command.  Default: the
       full terminal width.

       LEDGER_FILE The journal file path when not specified with -f.  Default:
       ~/.hledger.journal  (on  windows,  perhaps C:/Users/USER/.hledger.jour-
       nal).

FILES
       Reads data from one or more files in hledger journal, timeclock,  time-
       dot,   or   CSV   format   specified   with  -f,  or  $LEDGER_FILE,  or
       $HOME/.hledger.journal          (on          windows,           perhaps
       C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal).

LIMITATIONS
       The  need  to  precede  addon command options with -- when invoked from
       hledger is awkward.

       When input data contains non-ascii characters, a suitable system locale
       must be configured (or there will be an unhelpful error).  Eg on POSIX,
       set LANG to something other than C.

       In a Microsoft Windows CMD window, non-ascii characters and colours are
       not supported.

       On Windows, non-ascii characters may not display correctly when running
       a hledger built in CMD in MSYS/CYGWIN, or vice-versa.

       In a Cygwin/MSYS/Mintty window, the tab key is not supported in hledger
       add.

       Not  all of Ledger's journal file syntax is supported.  See file format
       differences.

       On large data files, hledger  is  slower  and  uses  more  memory  than
       Ledger.

TROUBLESHOOTING
       Here  are some issues you might encounter when you run hledger (and re-
       member you can also seek help from the IRC channel, mail  list  or  bug
       tracker):

       Successfully installed, but "No command 'hledger' found"
       stack and cabal install binaries into a special directory, which should
       be added to your PATH environment variable.  Eg on  unix-like  systems,
       that is ~/.local/bin and ~/.cabal/bin respectively.

       I set a custom LEDGER_FILE, but hledger is still using the default file
       LEDGER_FILE  should  be  a  real environment variable, not just a shell
       variable.  The command env | grep LEDGER_FILE should show it.  You  may
       need to use export.  Here's an explanation.

       "Illegal  byte  sequence"  or  "Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide
       character" errors
       In order to handle non-ascii letters and symbols (like ), hledger needs
       an appropriate locale.  This is usually configured system-wide; you can
       also configure it temporarily.  The locale may need to be one that sup-
       ports  UTF-8,  if you built hledger with GHC < 7.2 (or possibly always,
       I'm not sure yet).

       Here's  an  example  of  setting  the  locale  temporarily,  on  ubuntu
       gnu/linux:

              $ file my.journal
              my.journal: UTF-8 Unicode text                 # <- the file is UTF8-encoded
              $ locale -a
              C
              en_US.utf8                             # <- a UTF8-aware locale is available
              POSIX
              $ LANG=en_US.utf8 hledger -f my.journal print   # <- use it for this command

       Here's one way to set it permanently, there are probably better ways:

              $ echo "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8" >>~/.bash_profile
              $ bash --login

       If  we  preferred  to  use eg fr_FR.utf8, we might have to install that
       first:

              $ apt-get install language-pack-fr
              $ locale -a
              C
              en_US.utf8
              fr_BE.utf8
              fr_CA.utf8
              fr_CH.utf8
              fr_FR.utf8
              fr_LU.utf8
              POSIX
              $ LANG=fr_FR.utf8 hledger -f my.journal print

       Note some platforms allow variant locale spellings, but not all (ubuntu
       accepts fr_FR.UTF8, mac osx requires exactly fr_FR.UTF-8).
