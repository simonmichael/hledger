| *release*                           | A snapshot of the software and related artifacts like executable binaries, which is named, tagged, documented, announced, and usually picked up by packaging systems on various platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| *version control system, VCS*       | A tool used for storing and sharing and viewing the history and different lines of development of a software project, or other set of files. hledger uses Git.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *repository, repo*                  | A set of files being stored and managed by a VCS. Often published on a *repository hosting service*, such as Github.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| *working copy, clone*               | A local copy of a repository's files. Typically each developer has one or more of these, and can share changes easily with the official public repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| *branch*                            | Some VCS's, including Git, can store multiple branching lines of development within one repository. A working copy can be quickly switched to a different branch to show its content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *master, main*                      | The main branch in a repo, usually named `master` or `main`. Pull requests are usually relative to this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *pull request, PR*                  | A request to merge a development branch with master, and any related discussion. On Github, these are kept alongside issues in the issue tracker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| *continuous integration, CI*        | Automated actions that run when new code is pushed to a shared repo, such as running tests or producing binaries. On Github this is called Github Actions and action scripts are called *workflows*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| *package*                           | A releasable unit of Haskell software. hledger has several core packages usually released together: hledger-lib, hledger, hledger-ui, hledger-web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *hledger version number*            | A 2-4 part dotted number naming a hledger release or hledger package version: `MA.JOR[.MINOR[.FIXUP]]` or `MA.JOR.99[.PREVIEW]` where 99 means "unreleased (MAJOR+1)". See examples below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| *Complete, partial, mixed releases* | A release of all the core hledger packages (hledger-lib, hledger, hledger-ui, hledger-web) is called *complete*. A release of only some of the core packages is called *partial*. A release where some packages have different versions (because of a previous partial release) is called *mixed*. Major and preview releases are always complete, bugfix and fixup releases can be partial and/or mixed.                  |
| *changelog*                         | A CHANGES.md file listing the release history and the changes in each release.

|                                     | **hledger release/build types**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *Major release*                     | Major releases include new features and incompatible API changes, and normally happen at the start of each quarter's third month (3/1, 6/1, 9/1, 12/1). Example version number: `1.25`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *Bugfix release*                    | Bugfix releases include only bug fixes, without API changes. These happen when needed, to fix significant bugs in the previous major release. Example version number: `1.25.2` (*"second bugfix release for 1.25"*)                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *Fixup release*                     | Fixup releases fix packaging errors, with no changes to the hledger software. These should be rare. Example version number: `1.25.0.1` or `1.25.2.1` (*"first fixup release for 1.25 / 1.25.2"*)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| *Preview release*                   | A preview of the upcoming major release for testers/early adopters, and a test of the release process, published on Github. Not a formal hledger release, eg not published on Hackage, usually not packaged, no bugfix releases, no regression bounties, not shown in release notes. These typically appear in the quarter's first and second month if needed. Example version number: `1.25.99.1` (*"preview 1 of 1.26"*) |
| *CI binaries*                       | Temporary downloadable binaries produced by a run of the `linux`/`mac`/`windows` workflows in the hledger repo. This may happen periodically, eg weekly. Downloading requires a Github login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *Dev build*                         | A local developer build of unreleased code. This is typically in `master` or a development/PR branch. Example version number: `1.25.99` (*"unreleased 1.26-dev"*)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                                     | **hledger repos and branches**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| *hledger repo*                      | The `hledger` git repository, containing the hledger software, reference manuals, and developer docs. <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| *site repo*                         | The `hledger_website` git repository, containing most of the hledger website which appears at <https://hledger.org>. Usually checked out under the hledger repo as `site/`. <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger_website>                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *master*                            | The branch named `master` in the hledger repo; the main line of hledger development. Pull requests are usually relative to this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| *release&nbsp;branch*               | Branches named `MA.JOR-branch` in the hledger repo, eg `1.25-branch`. Releases and release previews are always made from a release branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Procedures

### 0. General tips
- Release (or practice releasing) often.
- Release responsibilities include:
  - **Software** - selecting changes, packages, release dates; coordinating contributions; ensuring release readiness
  - **Branch Management** - coordinating main and release branch, local and remote repos, CI branches
  - **Version Bumping** - choosing and applying new version numbers and related things like tags, github releases, urls, ghc and dep versions, stackage resolvers, everywhere needed
  - **Docs** - command help, manuals, changelogs, release notes, github release notes, install page, install scripts, announcements, process docs
  - **Testing** - local testing, CI testing, extra release-specific testing
  - **Artifacts** - generating binaries, zip files, github releases etc.
  - **Publishing** - uploading, pushing, making visible, finalising
  - **Announcing** - various announcement stages and channels
- These have complex interdependencies and sequencing constraints. Chunk, separate, routinise, document and automate them as far as possible.
- Don't document in too much detail prematurely.
- Follow RELEASING.md's procedures when helpful, ignore them when not.
- As step 1, save it as RELEASING2.md and make changes there until after release.
- Make things a little better each time through: simpler, more reliable, better documented, more automated, easier, faster, cheaper, higher quality.
- Update [CHANGELOGS](CHANGELOGS.html) early and often, eg during/after a PR, to spread the work.
- Make releases from a release branch, not from master.
- Before making binaries: try to do all possible pre-release-tag steps. (Binaries' --version shows their git hash, and it should match the release tag.)
- Before tagging: make binaries for all platforms, from the same commit.

### 1. Preview release
- [check release readiness](#check-release-readiness)
- [prepare release branch](#prepare-release-branch)
- [make binaries](#make-binaries)
- [tag the release](#tag-the-release)
- [push to github](#push-to-github)
- [make github release](#make-github-release)
- [update master from release branch](#update-master-from-release-branch)

#### Check release readiness
- master's changelogs are up to date (see [CHANGELOGS](CHANGELOGS.html))
- master or release branch is ready for release
  - clean and synced working copy
  - no pending release-blocking issues/prs
  - tests pass
- Shake is up to date
  - uses same resolver as stack.yaml
  - uses any required workarounds in stack.yaml
  - binary is up to date (`./Shake.hs`)
  - commit any changes (msg: `tools: shake`)
- appropriate timing, release manager availability

#### Prepare release branch
- `PAUSE=1 ECHO=1 tools/release prep MA.JOR[.99.PREVIEWNUM]` (eg 1.24.99.1 for 1.25 preview 1)
  (XXX seems to go wrong without PAUSE`)
- cherry pick changes from master
  - list changes in three side-by-side magit windows
    - 1. NEW IN MASTER: `l o MAJORVER-branch..master`, `M-x magit-toggle-buffer-lock`, `M-x toggle-window-dedicated` (`C-c D`)
    - 2. HEAD: regular magit status view
    - 3. RELEASE BRANCH: `l o MAJORVER-branch`, `M-x magit-toggle-buffer-lock`, `M-x toggle-window-dedicated`
  - in master window, working from bottom upward, cherry-pick all non-conflicting changes
    - skip changes already in release branch
    - skip changelog, command help, and manuals updates
- `./Shake cmdhelp -c`
- `./Shake manuals -c`
- update release changelogs (see [CHANGELOGS](CHANGELOGS.html))
- release branch testing
  - `stack build --test`
  - `make functest`
  - `stack exec -- hledger --version`, check version
  - `stack exec -- hledger help | tail`, check version & date

#### Make binaries
- `tools/release bin`
- get all platforms built on the same commit
- download binary artifact zip files

#### Tag the release
- `make tag`

#### Push to github
- `git push origin MA.JOR-branch && git push --tags`
- or in magit: `P p`, `P t`

#### Make github release
- copy text from previous similar release, https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases
- create new release, https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/new
- select release tag (MA.JOR[...])
- set title (MA.JOR[...])
- paste & replace with new release notes
- upload CI binaries
- save as draft
- github release testing (preview)
- publish

#### Update master from release branch
- switch back to master
- update master changelogs, merging final release changelog entries (see [CHANGELOGS](CHANGELOGS.html))
- cherry-pick other useful changes, such as `;doc: ANNOUNCE`
- after a major release: bump master to new dev version (`./Shake setversion -c A.B.99`)

### 2. Major release
- [make release notes](#make-release-notes)
- [make announcement](#make-announcement)
- [update hledger-install](#update-hledger-install)

    - "building from source"
    - stack install command
    - cabal install command
  - query-replace OLD-brightgreen -> OLD-red
  - only after release binaries are built (preferably after release is published):
    update --version outputs (search: hledger --version)
  - final output line from `hledger test` (run in terminal for normal speed)
  - Total count from `make functest`
  - commit: `download: NEW`

#### Add new manuals to website
In site repo:

  - nix - expect `make nix-hledger-version` to update after a few days, find and update to that commit hash
  - linux distros - once in a while, follow the links & search for newer versions, update
- provide support, monitor issues
- prepare followup releases if needed
- update process docs and tools

### Packaging

#### Update homebrew formula

1.  ref

    1.  helpers: chenrui & stack issue commenters on github, Athas on
        #haskell

    2.  <https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request>

    3.  doc

        If a URL is specified, the SHA-256 checksum of the new download
        should also be specified. A best effort to determine the SHA-256
        and formula name will be made if either or both values are not
        supplied by the user.

        If a tag is specified, the Git commit revision corresponding to
        that tag must also be specified.

        Note: this command cannot be used to transition a formula from a
        URL-and-SHA-256 style specification into a tag-and-revision
        style specifi- cation, nor vice versa. It must use whichever
        style specification the for- mula already uses.

2.  update homebrew working copy

    1.  cd \~/src/DEVTOOLS/homebrew-core

    2.  git reset --hard HEAD\~1 && git fetch origin && git merge
        origin/master && git push -f

3.  get release tarball checksums

    export V=X.Y; for P in -lib \"\" -ui -web; do curl -sO
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger$P-$V/hledger$P-$V.tar.gz>;
    done && shasum -a256 \*.gz

4.  update Formula/hledger.rb

    1.  update tarball urls, shas

    2.  update other version references

    3.  maybe update stackage snapshot

    4.  possible new process, see:
        <https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request#create-your-pull-request-from-a-new-branch>

    5.  test (if possible without too many mac/brew hassles)

        1.  brew audit --strict Formula/hledger.rb \# some tests are
            post-install, try also after brew upgrade

        2.  brew upgrade Formula/hledger.rb -s -n -v \# \[scrub download
            cache, dry run, verbose\]

            1.  super slow, how to speed up ?

                1.  comment out stack update

                2.  add , \"--stack-root=/Users/simon/.stack\" to stack
                    install \# fails on permissions

        3.  brew test Formula/hledger.rb

    6.  commit with name \"hledger X.Y\" and description \"Update to
        hledger X.Y.\"

5.  get merged

    1.  git push -f simonmichael

    2.  gh pr create -f

    3.  monitor: PR CI, PR merge,
        <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/hledger> page

    4.  ping brew contributors/maintainers if necessary: @chenrui,
        @carlocab, @SMillerDev

#### Update nix install command

1.  Wait for the new hledger version to land in nixpkgs

    1.  make nix-hledger-version

2.  Find the nixpkgs haskell-packages commit post-dating the hledger
    release:

    1.  make nix-view-commits \#
        <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commits/master/pkgs/development/haskell-modules/hackage-packages.nix>

3.  Test the nix-env install command with that commit hash

    1.  if it fails with \"SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was
        not OK\"
