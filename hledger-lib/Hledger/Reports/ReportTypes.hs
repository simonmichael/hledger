-- | A generic tabular report of some value, where each row corresponds to an account
-- and each column is a date period. The column periods are usually consecutive subperiods
-- formed by splitting the overall report period by some report interval (daily, weekly, etc.)
-- Depending on the value type, this can be a report of balance changes, ending balances,
-- budget performance, etc. Successor to MultiBalanceReport.
