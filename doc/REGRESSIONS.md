A regression is "something that used to work, that broke", or "an unintended not-good change"
in a released version of hledger.

We don't like regressions. We want to detect them quickly, repair them quickly, and reduce their frequency.

## Regression bounty

You can help!
For reports made between 2021-06-14 and 2023-12-31 we offered a $100 bounty for each new regression reported in hledger releases.
([original announcement](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1570))
For reports made since 2024-01-01, we offer $50 to the finder and $50 to the fixer (can be the same person, can't be the breaker).

To claim the bounty:

1. Discover a new regression yourself (and don't be the one who caused it)
2. Report it in the [hledger bug tracker](http://bugs.hledger.org)
3. Wait for the issue manager ([SM](https://joyful.com)) confirm it with the `regression` label
4. And/or, fix a regression yourself.
5. Send an expense reimbursement request to our Open Collective. 
   Be aware this might reveal your real name, on opencollective.com and here on hledger.org.
   Here's the suggested procedure for fastest processing:
   - click [Submit Expense](https://opencollective.com/hledger/expenses/new)  (if you are logged in, it will be under the ACTIONS menu) 
   - choose Invoice
   - choose a Payout method; click Next
   - Expense title: "Regression finder bounty for #NNNN" (or "fixer" or "finder & fixer")
   - Description: "Found ISSUEURL, WORKDATE(S)" (or "Fixed ...")
   - Date: today's date
   - Amount: USD 50 (or 100 if you found and fixed).
     Or if you choose to receive another currency, convert from USD with that day's conversion rate, and mention the rate in Description.
   - Next, Submit Expense
5. Announce on the issue page or in chat that you've submitted (to help ensure it is not overlooked)
6. Wait for the finance manager (SM) to approve it. This should not take more than a day or two.
7. Then wait for Open Collective to pay it. Payouts happen twice a week.
