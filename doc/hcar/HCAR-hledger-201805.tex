{\tt hledger} is a set of cross-platform tools (and Haskell libraries) for
tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry accounting
and a simple future-proof text file format.

It is an enhanced, well-documented reimplementation of plain text accounting
in Haskell, inspired by John Wiegley's Ledger program.

{\tt hledger} aims to be a reliable and practical tool for daily use, and
provides command-line, curses-style, and web interfaces.

{\tt hledger} is released under GNU GPLv3+.

Project activity has been continuous since our last update in November 2016.

Some notable developments:

\begin{compactitem}
\item The community has grown in size and activity. The number of committers has doubled, from 42 to 84.
\item Website, documentation, CI and project infrastructure have been improved
\item A cross-platform installer script has been added
\item Many fixes, refinements, and new features have been added, such as:
\item balance assignments
\item pivot
\item periodic transactions
\item automated postings
\item budget reports
\item normal-positive reports
\item HTML output

hledger is available from the hledger.org website, Github, Hackage, or
Stackage. It is packaged for a number of systems (Windows, Homebrew, most
GNU/Linux distros, NixOS, Sandstorm..) and buildable on other systems
supporting GHC (freeBSD, openBSD..).
