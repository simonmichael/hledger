A ledger-compatible @balance@ command, with additional support for
multi-column reports.

Here is a description/specification for the balance command.  See also
"Hledger.Reports" -> \"Balance reports\".


/Basic balance report/

With no report interval (@--monthly@ etc.), hledger's balance
command emulates ledger's, showing accounts indented according to
hierarchy, along with their total amount posted (including subaccounts).

Here's an example. With @examples/sample.journal@, which defines the following account tree:

@
 assets
   bank
     checking
     saving
   cash
 expenses
   food
   supplies
 income
   gifts
   salary
 liabilities
   debts
@

the basic @balance@ command gives this output:

@
 $ hledger -f sample.journal balance
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0
@

Subaccounts are displayed indented below their parent. Only the account leaf name (the final part) is shown.
(With @--flat@, account names are shown in full and unindented.)

Each account's \"balance\" is the sum of postings in that account and any subaccounts during the report period.
When the report period includes all transactions, this is equivalent to the account's current balance.

The overall total of the highest-level displayed accounts is shown below the line.
(The @--no-total/-N@ flag prevents this.)

/Eliding and omitting/

Accounts which have a zero balance, and no non-zero subaccount
balances, are normally omitted from the report.
(The @--empty/-E@ flag forces such accounts to be displayed.)
Eg, above @checking@ is omitted because it has a zero balance and no subaccounts.

Accounts which have a single subaccount also being displayed, with the same balance,
are normally elided into the subaccount's line.
(The @--no-elide@ flag prevents this.)
Eg, above @bank@ is elided to @bank:saving@ because it has only a
single displayed subaccount (@saving@) and their balance is the same
($1). Similarly, @liabilities@ is elided to @liabilities:debts@.

/Date limiting/

The default report period is that of the whole journal, including all
known transactions. The @--begin\/-b@, @--end\/-e@, @--period\/-p@
options or @date:@/@date2:@ patterns can be used to report only
on transactions before and/or after specified dates.

/Depth limiting/

The @--depth@ option can be used to limit the depth of the balance report.
Eg, to see just the top level accounts (still including their subaccount balances):

@
$ hledger -f sample.journal balance --depth 1
                 $-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $-2  income
                  $1  liabilities
--------------------
                   0
@

/Account limiting/

With one or more account pattern arguments, the report is restricted
to accounts whose name matches one of the patterns, plus their parents
and subaccounts. Eg, adding the pattern @o@ to the first example gives:

@
 $ hledger -f sample.journal balance o
                  $1  expenses:food
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
--------------------
                 $-1
@

* The @o@ pattern matched @food@ and @income@, so they are shown.

* @food@'s parent (@expenses@) is shown even though the pattern didn't
  match it, to clarify the hierarchy. The usual eliding rules cause it to be elided here.

* @income@'s subaccounts are also shown.

/Multi-column balance report/

hledger's balance command will show multiple columns when a reporting
interval is specified (eg with @--monthly@), one column for each sub-period.

There are three kinds of multi-column balance report, indicated by the heading:

* A \"period balance\" (or \"flow\") report (the default) shows the change of account
  balance in each period, which is equivalent to the sum of postings in each
  period. Here, checking's balance increased by 10 in Feb:

  > Change of balance (flow):
  >
  >                  Jan   Feb   Mar
  > assets:checking   20    10    -5

* A \"cumulative balance\" report (with @--cumulative@) shows the accumulated ending balance
  across periods, starting from zero at the report's start date.
  Here, 30 is the sum of checking postings during Jan and Feb:

  > Ending balance (cumulative):
  >
  >                  Jan   Feb   Mar
  > assets:checking   20    30    25

* A \"historical balance\" report (with @--historical/-H@) also shows ending balances,
  but it includes the starting balance from any postings before the report start date.
  Here, 130 is the balance from all checking postings at the end of Feb, including
  pre-Jan postings which created a starting balance of 100:

  > Ending balance (historical):
  >
  >                  Jan   Feb   Mar
  > assets:checking  120   130   125

/Eliding and omitting, 2/

Here's a (imperfect?) specification for the eliding/omitting behaviour:

* Each account is normally displayed on its own line.

* An account less deep than the report's max depth, with just one
interesting subaccount, and the same balance as the subaccount, is
non-interesting, and prefixed to the subaccount's line, unless
@--no-elide@ is in effect.

* An account with a zero inclusive balance and less than two interesting
subaccounts is not displayed at all, unless @--empty@ is in effect.

* Multi-column balance reports show full account names with no eliding
  (like @--flat@). Accounts (and periods) are omitted as described below.

/Which accounts to show in balance reports/

By default:

* single-column: accounts with non-zero balance in report period.
                 (With @--flat@: accounts with non-zero balance and postings.)

* periodic:      accounts with postings and non-zero period balance in any period

* cumulative:    accounts with non-zero cumulative balance in any period

* historical:    accounts with non-zero historical balance in any period

With @-E/--empty@:

* single-column: accounts with postings in report period

* periodic:      accounts with postings in report period

* cumulative:    accounts with postings in report period

* historical:    accounts with non-zero starting balance +
                 accounts with postings in report period

/Which periods (columns) to show in balance reports/

An empty period/column is one where no report account has any postings.
A zero period/column is one where no report account has a non-zero period balance.

Currently,

by default:

* single-column: N/A

* periodic:      all periods within the overall report period,
                 except for leading and trailing empty periods

* cumulative:    all periods within the overall report period,
                 except for leading and trailing empty periods

* historical:    all periods within the overall report period,
                 except for leading and trailing empty periods

With @-E/--empty@:

* single-column: N/A

* periodic:      all periods within the overall report period

* cumulative:    all periods within the overall report period

* historical:    all periods within the overall report period

/What to show in empty cells/

An empty periodic balance report cell is one which has no corresponding postings.
An empty cumulative/historical balance report cell is one which has no corresponding
or prior postings, ie the account doesn't exist yet.
Currently, empty cells show 0.

This implementation turned out to be a bit convoluted but implements the following algorithm for formatting:

- If there is a single amount, print it with the account name directly:
- Otherwise, only print the account name on the last line.

    a         USD 1   ; Account 'a' has a single amount
              EUR -1
    b         USD -1  ; Account 'b' has two amounts. The account name is printed on the last line.
