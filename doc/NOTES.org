hledger project notes

*We are all wandering the orderly halls of Castle Haskell.*

*This whole plain is gunpowder a mile deep.*

* about
This emacs org-mode outline contains Simon's project backlog, activity
log, and random developer notes.  Currently only I use this file, but
anyone can send a patch.
** backlog
Todos and wishlist items, roughly grouped by category and ordered by (my)
priority. Used for planning, and often as a more lightweight bug
tracker. Also contains..
** estimates
I keep effort-to-complete estimates on backlog tasks as N[dwm] at the end
of the line following two spaces, meaning N hours, days, weeks or months,
assuming 4 hours in day, 5 days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month.
** burndown charts
At some point there might be a process to aggregate estimates, log them
(including deleted items as 0) on commit, and make burndown charts.

* routines
standard procedures/checklists for various activities

** inspiration
"...simplicity of design was the most essential, guiding principle.
Clarity of concepts, economy of features, efficiency and reliability of
implementations were its consequences." --Niklaus Wirth

"The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own
skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids
clever tricks like the plague." --Edsger Dijkstra

"I was hesitating to cross the street in Edinburgh one day, and these two
little old Scottish ladies cried out to me 'LIVE DANGEROUSLY, SON! LIVE
DANGEROUSLY'" --kowey

ALL THAT'S NEEDED IS THE DESIRE TO BE HEARD. THE WILL TO LEARN. AND THE
ABILITY TO SEE.  --Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics

** principles
*** we aim to make reliable, maintainable, usable, useful software, sustainably.
*** docs before packaging before tests before fixes before refactoring before features
*** "bugs" are errors, as in the programmers messed up
*** automate
*** measure
*** test continuously, test everything
*** less is more
*** code review/pair programming

** things I want to know about money and time
*** time
where have I been spending my time in recent weeks ?
where have I spent my time today ?
what is my status wrt spending plan for this week/month/year ?
what is my current status wrt time spending goals ?
*** money
where have I been spending my money ?
what is my status wrt spending plan for this week/month/year ?
what is my current status wrt spending/savings goals ?
what are all my current balances ?
what does my balance history look like ?
what does my balance future look like ?
are there any cashflow, tax, budgetary problems looming ?
*** charts
[1:27pm] <sm> I have decided I am not getting enough visible day-to-day value out of my ledger, I need more of that to stay motivated
[1:27pm] <Nafai> What do you think will help in that?
[1:27pm] <sm> I think some simple self-updating charts, or even good reports in a visible place
[1:28pm] <sm> something I don't have to spend an hour fiddling with to get answers
[1:38pm] <sm> Nafai: identifying/designing some useful reports/charts seems to be blocking me
[1:39pm] <sm> there are probably some standard ones I should use
[1:40pm] <sm> a graph of daily net worth is probably one of the simplest
[1:58pm] <sm> what else.. a chart of weekly expenses in key categories
[1:58pm] <sm> ditto, monthly
[1:58pm] <sm> a chart of monthly income
[1:59pm] <sm> those three should help me be more clear about cashflow status
[2:00pm] <sm> also I'd like something that shows me how much I am on top of financial tracking - how current my numbers are, when last reconciled etc - at a glance
[2:01pm] <sm> another simple one: current balances in all accounts
[2:01pm] <sm> those would be a great start
[2:04pm] <sm> daily net worth, weekly expense, monthly expense, monthly income, confidence/currentness report, and balance report
[2:05pm] <sm> let's see, which of those 6 would give most payoff right now
[2:05pm] <sm> probably 5
[2:06pm] <sm> how could I measure that ?
[2:06pm] <sm> number of days since last ledger entry..
[2:06pm] <sm> number of ledger entries in last 30 days (compared to average)
[2:07pm] <sm> number of days since last cleared checking entry (indicating an online reconcile)
[2:08pm] <sm> those would be a good start. How do I make those visual
[2:09pm] <sm> well I guess the first step is a script to print them

*** hledger ghci examples
This is the main object you'll deal with as a user of the Ledger
library. 

The most useful functions also have shorter, lower-case aliases for easier
interaction. Here's an example:

> > j <- readJournal "sample.ledger"
> > let l = journalToLedger nullfilterspec j
> > accountnames l

*** ledger budgeting/forecasting
seanh:

With `--budget` you can compare your budgeted transactions to your
actual transactions and see whether you are under or over your budget.

The way it works is this: say you have a budget entry that moves £50
from Assets into Expenses:Cash every week:

    ~ Weekly
      Expenses:Cash  £50
      Assets

When you run register or balance with `--budget` ledger will insert
reverse transactions that move £50 _from_ Expenses:Cash _into_ Assets
every week. These are called budget entries. The idea is that your real
transactions that move money from Assets into Expenses will offset the
inserted budget entries that move money the other way. The budget
entries and the real transactions should sum to zero, if they don't then
it shows how much you have overspent or underspent.

For example:

    ledger --budget balance '^expenses'

balances your budgeted expenses against your actual expenses on those
budgeted accounts (sub-accounts of expenses that do not appear in the
budget are ignored in this calculation). The sum of the budget entries
(which move money out of expenses accounts) and your real transactions
(which move money into expenses accounts) should be 0. If the sum is
positive then it shows how much you've overspent, if it's negative then
it shows how much you've underspent.

You can do the same with register and get a print out of each
transaction (budget entries and real transactions) with a running total:

    ledger --budget register '^expenses'

And you can produce weekly, monthly or yearly budget reports:

   ledger --budget --weekly register '^expenses'
   ledger --budget --monthly register '^expenses'
   ledger --budget --yearly register '^expenses'

These will only output reports for each week, month or year that has
passed (your ledger file contains transactions dated later than that
week, month, or year). You can see how well you did last week (or month,
or year) but you can't see how well you're doing so far this week
(month, year).

The `--unbudgeted` argument will show (and sum) all your expenses for
accounts that are _not_ budgeted, and the `--add-budget` argument will
consider all your expenses budgeted or not with the budget entries
added in.

With `--forecast` you can project your budget into the future to see,
for example, when some account will reach 0. For example, to predict
your net worth:

    ledger --forecast 'd<[2012]' register '^assets' '^liabilities'

Or to see how your expenses will add up:

    ledger --forecast 'd<[2012]' register '^expenses'

*** essential/getting started info

I've never used financial management software before, I'm just confused at what I'm doing.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system
money isn't created or destroyed, it moves between accounts
all possible accounts are organised under five categories: assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses 

the gist of it for *ledger users is that each transaction in your journal (file) is balanced, ie its postings add up to zero
typically you have a posting to some account (expenses:food  $10) and an equal posting from another (assets:cash  $-10)

so should things like income be a forever-decreasing value?
yes

I think traditional bookkeeping uses "debit"  and "credit" for (among other things) hiding the negative sign
I wonder, if folks had been comfortable with negative numbers in the middle ages, if debit/credit would have been invented

so, when I start a ledger file and I start my initial account balances for, say, checking, I withdraw them from equity or income?  Or does it matter in this case?
traditionally, you transfer opening balances from equity
and this is just a convention, or is there some better reason behind it?
I believe it's actually based on the real-world meaning, and makes sense if you study enough bookkeeping
I thought equity was more a share of something owned.
that's right, and if you squint enough the two uses are equivalent
So I'd do something like "assets:checking $foo \ assets:savings $bar \ liabilities:creditcard $-baz \ equity:opening balance"?
yes

what about loans?  Those are liabilities, right?
yes

okay.  So after I set up my initial account balances, it's just a matter of keeping track how and what I spend.
yup, tracking your checking account's or your wallet's inflows and outflows is a good way to start
Gradually you'll add more tricky things like invoices and short-term loans (accounts receivable/payable)


I also read in the manual that you can set up routine actions, like debiting from one account and crediting to another on a monthly basis.
this can help me set up budgets, right?
yes, ledger lets you specify those with special modifier/periodic transactions. They appear in reports but not in your journal file. Or you can use cron or something to actually add them to the journal
and there's also a budget report feature

a catalog of standard bookkeeping entries for typical real-world transactions is really helpful and worth searching for

** hledger feedback
*** fabrice niessen
+For me, what would be very useful for a 1.0 version would be:
+
+- @check directive (see beancount), but implemented as a comment for ledger,
+  so that ledger does not get confused by this, and that you can implement
+  more features without breaking backward compatibility;
+
+- account declaration (see beancount), in ledger comments. Giving an account
+  number would (or could) help for the reporting stuff, for knowing which
+  value to get to read, for inserting in a given report;
+
+- some built-in ratios for being able to see the health of the finances (see
+  my Excel file, if you're interested);
+
+- easier standard outputs, such as the one above (with expenses and income in
+  2 columns).
+
+- real report generation (I thought at LaTeX as in SQL Ledger, but I am now
+  heading and producing reports through Org, which is 1000x better). Results
+  soon.
+

*** Martin Wuertele, debian:
I see our task not in keeping accounts (that's in the responsibility of
the trusted bodies) but more in management accounts. In order to achieve
that we need a solution that mirrors the financials of the trusted
bodies, has a way to streamline them (allign different local chart of
accounts or reporting formats to an unified one), do some
reclassifications and accruals on top, performe currency conversions (we
have debian.uk, debian.ch, FFIS, SPI-INC,...), accumulate the results,
add additional reclassifications and accruals on top and, in some cases,
add consolidation entries (e.g.  SPI-INC does reembursement but gets
itself reembursed by FFIS).

We do not bother with any local tasks like income tax, vat or
statistical filing, invoicing and the like.

** my hamlet feedback
*** thread data through nested templates with Reader monad
*** HDString constructor for HamletData ?
*** data type for non-RT Hamlet as well, or better, the same type for both
*** allow (RT or non-RT) templates in $ $ as well, drop ^ ^
*** allow literal arguments in references
*** easier verbatim content quoting, eg lines starting with \\. Having to escape $$ is not so convenient for jquery
*** docs and compiler errors should say something clearer than "Hamlet url" (Hamlet routetype, urltype, routet, urlt ?)


*** 2010/8
**** $ $ could handle templates as well; drop ^ ^
**** @ @ could recognise tuples automatically; drop ?
**** why !: : for conditional attributes ? How about !? ?

Since you're practicing your writing, I'll give some tips:

> cabal is a command-line program for downloading and building
> software written in Haskell. It can install all kinds of fascinating
> and useful software packages from the Hackage repository. It is
> excellent and indispensable, but it currently has a troublesome
> flaw: it sometimes mysteriously refuses to install things, leading

The above paragraph keeps referring back to cabal as it, which
increases the reader's cognitive load. The reader must retain the
first sentence in memory to understand the rest of the paragraph,
perhaps referring back to it if they already flushed the first
sentence from memory. A well-written article resembles an efficient
program: you strive to stream all the information in as little memory
as possible so that the reader can ideally use the smallest and most
efficient cache while reading.

> A little extra know-how prevents this. This tutorial aims to show
> you how to install cabal packages with confidence, especially if you

The second paragraph repeats the same error as the first
paragraph. Your first this refers to something in the previous
paragraph, which prevents the user from mentally freeing the former
paragraph. Every paragraph should make sense in isolation if you want
to improve readability.

> Your system may have a package manager, like apt-get, yum, or
> macports, and it might offer packages for the Haskell software you
> want to install. In this case you may save time by using it instead
> of cabal. It probably offers more stable, better-integrated
> packages, and they may be pre-compiled.

Every paragraph's first sentence should serve as an abstract for that
paragraph. Readers use the first sentence of each paragraph to judge
whether or not to read it. In fact, well-written essays will still
read well if you just replace each paragraph with its first sentence.

> In short: this tutorial is about using cabal-install, which is cabal
> on the command line.

Your summary sentence belongs in your first paragraph. The first
paragraph behaves like an abstract for the rest of the article.

> It is often available as a system package, otherwise get it by
> installing the Haskell Platform, or just GHC.

Avoid passive tense as much as possible, because it requires the
reader to infer the actor in the sentence, increasing their cognitive
load. For example, you could rephrase the above sentence as "System
package managers often provide cabal, but you can also obtain it from
the Haskell Platform".

> To check that it's installed, at a command prompt do:

Get to the verb of a sentence within about 7-ish words, the earlier
the better. Sentences resemble thunks, and you cannot force the thunk
until you get to the verb. You actually stick to this rule pretty
well, although you lapse a few times throughout the article.

You also do several things very well:

- You motivate everything you teach by introducing each topic as the
  solution to a specific, practical problem.

- You emphasize showing the reader rather than telling them.

Finally, spend lots of time rewriting for articles that you care a lot
about. I find that my most well-received posts are the ones I rewrite
repeatedly over a week. You always view your own writing with fresh
eyes after every full night's rest.

Usage: hledger [OPTIONS] COMMAND [PATTERNS]
       hledger [OPTIONS] convert CSVFILE

Reads your ~/.journal file, or another specified by $LEDGER or -f, and
runs the specified command (may be abbreviated):

  add       - prompt for new transactions and add them to the journal
  balance   - show accounts, with balances
  convert   - show the specified CSV file as a hledger journal
  histogram - show a barchart of transactions per day or other interval
  print     - show transactions in journal format
  register  - show transactions as a register with running balance
  stats     - show various statistics for a journal
  test      - run self-tests

hledger options:
  -f FILE  --file=FILE        use a different journal/timelog file; - means stdin
           --no-new-accounts  don't allow to create new accounts
  -b DATE  --begin=DATE       report on transactions on or after this date
  -e DATE  --end=DATE         report on transactions before this date
  -p EXPR  --period=EXPR      report on transactions during the specified period
                              and/or with the specified reporting interval
  -C       --cleared          report only on cleared transactions
  -U       --uncleared        report only on uncleared transactions
  -B       --cost, --basis    report cost of commodities
           --depth=N          hide accounts/transactions deeper than this
  -d EXPR  --display=EXPR     show only transactions matching EXPR (where
                              EXPR is 'dOP[DATE]' and OP is <, <=, =, >=, >)
           --effective        use transactions' effective dates, if any
  -E       --empty            show empty/zero things which are normally elided
  -R       --real             report only on real (non-virtual) transactions
           --flat             balance: show full account names, unindented
           --drop=N           balance: with --flat, elide first N account name components
           --no-total         balance: hide the final total
  -D       --daily            register, stats: report by day
  -W       --weekly           register, stats: report by week
  -M       --monthly          register, stats: report by month
  -Q       --quarterly        register, stats: report by quarter
  -Y       --yearly           register, stats: report by year
  -v       --verbose          show more verbose output
           --debug            show extra debug output; implies verbose
           --binary-filename  show the download filename for this hledger build
  -V       --version          show version information
  -h       --help             show command-line usage

DATES can be y/m/d or smart dates like "last month".  PATTERNS are regular
expressions which filter by account name.  Prefix a pattern with desc: to
filter by transaction description instead, prefix with not: to negate it.
When using both, not: comes last.

hledger is a robust command-line accounting tool with a simple plain text data format.

hledger is a reporting tool for accounting transactions stored in a simple human-editable text format.

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other transactions, usually recorded in a general journal file with a simple human-editable markup format.

hledger is primarily a reporting tool, but it can also help you add transactions to the journal, or convert from other data formats.

hledger is a haskell port and friendly fork of John Wiegley's c++ ledger tool.

hledger aims to be a reliable, practical, useful tool for (slightly geeky) users and a reusable library for haskell programmers interested in finance.

hledger is quite simple in essence, aiming to be a reliable low-level parsing-and-reporting tool that doesn't get in your way.

For some, it is a less complex, less expensive, more efficient alternative to Quicken or Quickbooks.

hledger is available for free under the GNU General Public License.

hledger reads plain text files (general journal, timelog, or CSV format) describing transactions (in money, time or other commodities) and prints the chart of accounts, account balances, or transactions you're interested in.

hledger is a free program that helps you understand your finances, making calculations based on data stored a simple text file. If you prefer the command line and a text editor to a big gui application, hledger gives you the power of Quicken and Quickbooks without the complexity.

Your financial data will outlive your financial software, so it should have longevity and accessibility. Its integrity is important to your peace of mind, so changes should be transparent and (if desired) version controlled. It may also be important to allow multiple authors to edit safely. A structured, easy-to-parse, human-friendly plain text format, as in the wiki world, provides a good balance of longevity, reliability, transparency and flexibility.

hledger helps you track and understand your finances, making calculations based on data stored in a simple text file. If you prefer the command line and a text editor to a big gui application, hledger gives you the power of Quicken and Quickbooks without the complexity.

Features: reads transactions in journal, timelog, or CSV format; handles multi-currency/multi-commodity transactions; prints the chart of accounts, account balances, or transactions you're interested in, quickly; scriptable.

hledger is written in the Haskell programming language;
it demonstrates a pure functional implementation of ledger.

**** life cycle of top-level accounts
For personal ledgers, when you're born, all accounts are at zero (one hopes) and as you live:

1. Equity accounts accommodate your previous years of not maintaining accounts (fixed, probably negative) 

2. Expense accounts become more and more positive (unavoidably) 

3. Income accounts become more and more negative (on payday) 

4. Assets Accounts become more and more positive (in good times) 

5. Liability account become more positive (in good times, when you pay them off) and more negative (when you use them to buy things). 

When you die, Equity: and Income: will stand at large negative balances,
Expense: and Assets: will stand at large positive balances and Liabilities
will have to be paid (out of Assets) before your heirs get what's left.

***** testing

hledger's unit tests and a simple test runner are built in. They can
be run several ways:

$ hledger test [PAT]
$ make unittest
$ make autotest

They can also be built as a separate executable, in case needed for
cabal test. (?) This requires test-framework, which may not work on
windows.

$ make unittest-standalone

hledger's functional tests are a set of @shelltestrunner@ tests defined
by .test files in the tests\/ subdirectory.

$ make functest

Shell tests can also be defined as doctests, literal blocks embedded
in modules' haddock docs, though this is hardly used. For example:

@
$ bin\/hledger -f data\/sample.journal balance o
                  $1  expenses:food
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary

     How to grow the hledger project ?

     I'm looking for ways to fund active and sustainable hledger
     development by me and others.

     A secondary goal is to develop new sustainable models and processes
     for funding free software developers and other community projects.

     This is sometimes the point in a free sw project's development where
     the project leader seemingly loses the plot, alienates contributors
     and destroys the community's good-will dynamic.  I've seen it many
     times, but a few have succeeded and I want to be one of them - so
     that I can eat, have a modicum of stability and do my best work in
     service to the community.  At worst, I'll look bad but the project
     will still be out there. At best I'll live more easily and joyfully
     while serving the cause of Financial Solvency!

     So I'm beginning by posting these notes and inviting your thoughts -
     as much or as little as folks want to give. How could we do this 
     so that all benefit ?
     
funding models
==============
     Brainstorming some possible funding models & processes.

     * grants

      How to find possible grant sources ?

      * con

       * getting grant funding is a whole new field to study
       * slow and time intensive, I imagine

     * donations

      Solicit donations.

      * pro

       * simple

      * con

       * often difficult
       * donators do not feel a direct benefit

     * shareware

      Release the project under a non-free license, requiring commercial
      users to pay the fee on an honour basis (eg).

      * pro

       * flexible, low administration, encourages trust

      * con

       * effectively closed-source ? would inhibit collaboration
       * benefit is still indirect, only a proportion will pay
       * enforcement/guilt may come into play

     * limited-time premium branch

      The funded version of hledger gets some desirable premium features
      before the free version and is closed-source.  Funders/customers pay
      a fixed price for immediate access to the funded version.  Yearly, a
      new funded version is released and the old funded version is merged
      into the free version.  (To gain experience it could be done on a
      smaller scale, eg monthly/quarterly.)

      * pro

       * all features reach community, predictably
       * customers are also community funders
       * customers receive direct benefit from paying

      * con

       * free sw developers compete/outshine the premium branch

     * bounties

      Some (or all) feature, bugfix, project management or other tasks are
      published with a bounty attached.  When the bounty is paid by one or
      more funders, the task is performed and delivered. Or, bounty is paid
      on completion of task (honour system).

      * pro

       * funders receive direct benefit

     * bounties using fundable.org (eg)

      A more organised form of the above, perhaps facilitating trust,
      co-funding and larger bounties.

      * pro

       * proven process developed by others

      * con

       * fundable takes a cut

     * hosted service

      Offer hosted and managed ledgers, perhaps with premium features, for
      a monthly fee

      * pro

       * proven model
       * clear benefit to customers, especially non-technies

      * con
 
       * success of free/self-installed version competes with hosting service
       * some will avoid web-hosting their financial data

     * customisation

      Offer per-user customisations, possibly to be merged in the trunk,
      for a fee

     * support

      Offer user/developer support for a fee

     * training

      Offer application and/or financial training for a fee

     * profit sharing/tithing

      Each period (quarter, half-year, year), donate 10% (eg) to project

     * transparent funding

      Funding and usage of funds is published on the web as a ledger

     * opaque funding

      All funding and spending need not be made public

strengths
=========
     hledger has some aptitudes in this area:

    * hledger deals with money => hledger users will tend to have some money
    * hledger's purpose is to increase financial success => users will feel its value to their bottom line
    * hledger is a tool that can support project funding, eg by publishing community funding data

weaknesses
==========
    * hledger doesn't have a nice ui yet
    * hledger has a limited featureset
    * hledger requires work, eg data entry and chart of accounts maintenance
    * hledger is geeky
    * there is competition
    * hledger has no compelling market niche (aside from payment-averse free software users)

competitors/fellow niche inhabitants
====================================

    * web apps

     * netsuite
     * sql-ledger, ledgersmb
     * wesabe

**** in-place transaction editing fund drive

Fund drive: hledger-web in-place transaction editing

Goal: I would like to raise $X or more to fund basic in-place
transaction editing for hledger-web. hledger-web is a web-based GUI for
hledger (and ledger), which are free/open-source accounting programs
providing a lean and efficient alternative to quicken, gnucash, mint.com
etc.

Current hledger-web[1] has simple web forms for adding transactions and
for editing the whole journal, but there is no easy ui for editing a
single existing transaction. Such a ui is an important step towards making
hledger (and ledger) usable by non techies, which would greatly expand
these tools' applicability and potential user/contributor base.

Plan: do the front-end javascript and backend haskell work required to
support:

- click date, description, account or amount cells in a register view to make that cell editable
- tab moves to the next cell
- enter or click on save button updates the transaction in the journal, overwriting/rewriting the whole file
- tested in firefox/chrome/safari

The proposed amount will fund about 10 hours of work, so the above
features must be implemented very expeditiously. Other improvements will
be tackled in a followup fund drive if this one succeeds (or in this one
if the funding goal is exceeded.) Those future items include:

- history/content awareness, smart defaults and auto-completion wherever useful
- date picker widget
- ability to add/remove postings
- ability to edit metadata/tags
- ability to edit other transaction/posting fields
- ledger compatibility
- compatibility testing/fixes for all the major browsers
- edit conflict checking - don't overwrite concurrent external edits
- try harder to preserve existing file layout/co-exist better with external edits
- a similar ui for adding new transactions
- pleasant visual style

Also, 10% of the amount raised will be tithed to three contributing
projects or developers (ledger and two others of my choice.)

This project will go forward if

**** MaybeSo subtotal rounding issue
I had a question about balance totals. Given this test data: 

$ cat test.dat 
D $1,000.00 
P 2011-01-01 22:00:00-0800 TESTA $78.35 
P 2011-01-01 22:00:00-0800 TESTB $15.86 
P 2011-01-01 22:00:09-0800 TESTC $13.01 

2011/01/01 Example 
  Assets:Brokerage:TESTA         188.424 TESTA @      $76.61 
  Assets:Brokerage:TESTB       1,809.282 TESTB @      $15.60 
  Assets:Brokerage:TESTC         384.320 TESTC @@  $5,000.00 
  Assets:Brokerage:TESTC           5.306 TESTC @@     $68.18 
  Equity:Opening Balances 

I'm a little bit surprised that the sub-accounts 
reflect a difference from the top level account 
w/re to rounding the last cent: 

$ ledger -V -f test.dat  bal 
          $48,527.27  Assets:Brokerage 
          $14,763.02    TESTA 
          $28,695.21    TESTB 
           $5,069.03    TESTC 
         $-47,728.14  Equity:Opening Balances 
-------------------- 
             $799.13 

Even if --no-rounding is passed in: 

$ ledger -V -f test.dat --no-rounding bal 
          $48,527.27  Assets:Brokerage 
          $14,763.02    TESTA 
          $28,695.21    TESTB 
           $5,069.03    TESTC 
         $-47,728.14  Equity:Opening Balances 
-------------------- 
             $799.13 

Is there something off with how the data aboce is set up?  Should I be 
using be more place holders?

**** goals
***** allow separately-packaged functionality to be discovered at run-time and integrated within the hledger ui.
Example: user installs hledger-ofx package from hackage, or adds Ofx.hs to their ~/.hledger/plugins/;
then "ofx" is among the commands listed by hledger --help, and/or is a new command available in
the web and vty interfaces, and/or is a new file format understood by the convert command.
**** issues to consider
***** what is the api for plugins ?
they'll want to import Ledger lib, to work with ledger data structures

***** there are different kinds of "plugin". What could plugins provide ?
****** commands - for all uis, or for one or more of them (cli, web, vty..). A command may itself be a new ui.
****** import/export formats
****** skins/styles/templates for uis, eg the web ui ?
**** techniques to consider
***** running executables provided by plugins
a cli command plugin: cli execs the executable with same arguments
a web command plugin: web ui runs the executable as a subprocess and captures the output
***** linking plugins into main app with direct-plugins
simplification of plugins lib
main app needs to know the types used in plugin's interface
weakens type safety, avoiding runtime errors requires extra care
requires whole-program linking at plugin load time
plugins can be discovered by querying ghc for installed packages or modules in a known part of the hierarchy
maintained and keen to help
***** linking plugins into main app with plugins (original)
more complex than above
more type-safe/featureful ?
***** doing whatever xmonad does with dyre
***** interpreting plugins under control of main app with hint
ghci in an IO-like monad
types need converting, etc.
plugins may run more slowly
plugins can be discovered/loaded by module path or by loading files directly
