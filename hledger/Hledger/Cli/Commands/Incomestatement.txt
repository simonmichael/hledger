incomestatement, is
This command displays a simple income statement, showing revenues and
expenses during a period. It assumes that these accounts are under a
top-level revenue or income or expense account (case insensitive, plural
forms also allowed). Note this report shows all account balances with
normal positive sign (like conventional financial statements, unlike
balance/print/register) (experimental).

With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for each
report period. Normally incomestatement shows revenues/expenses per
period, though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the
report mode with --change/--cumulative/--historical. Instead of absolute
values percentages can be displayed with -%.

This command also supports output destination and output format
selection.
