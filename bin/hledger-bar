# hledger-bar - show quick bar charts in the terminal.

usage() {
    cat <<'EOS'
Usage:
hledger-bar    [-h|--help]
hledger-bar    [-v|-vv] [SCALE] BALARGS
hledger bar -- [-v|-vv] [SCALE] BALARGS  # might need extra quoting

Requires bash (or osh) and hledger >= ~1.25.

With no arguments, shows this help.
Otherwise, runs hledger's 'balance' command, reporting monthly
balance changes by default, and shows the period totals as a bar chart
in the terminal, with positive amounts shown as '+' and negatives as '-'
(in green and red respectively, unless NO_COLOR is set).

Bars are not auto-sized; they will be (amount divided by SCALE) long, where
SCALE is 100 by default. This is overrideable by a numeric first argument.
Eg if bars are too long, try 200; if they are too short, try 50.

Most other options/arguments understood by the balance command can be
used, such as one or more account names, or different report intervals
like -W (weekly) or -Q (quarterly).  There are two restrictions:

- You must ensure the report is for a single commodity. So use eg
  'cur:€' or 'cur:\\$' or 'cur:\\\\$' or '-B' or '-X$ --infer-market-prices'
  as needed.

- You can't use spaces in arguments (even quoted). If needed,
  you could write '.' instead of space.

If you don't see the results you expect:

- Note that revenues appear negative and expenses positive,
  as with the balance command; to flip signs, use --invert.

- Run as 'hledger-bar' to minimise command line quoting issues.

- Use -v as first argument to also show the (unscaled, rounded) amounts.

- Use -vv as first argument to show the amounts and the balance command
  (approximately; you might need to add one level of quoting).
  Tip: remove some of this command's first options to see a more
  human-readable balance report.

- When you are reporting changes in asset/liability/equity accounts,
  you will probably want to exclude opening/closing balance transactions,
  eg with not:desc:'(opening|closing)' or not:tag:clopen if you use those.

Examples:

$ hledger-bar food                              # monthly food expenses
$ hledger-bar 1 --count food                    # monthly food posting counts
$ hledger-bar -v 1 -f $TIMELOG -D               # daily hours, with numbers
$ hledger-bar type:c not:tag:clopen cur:\\$ -W  # weekly cashflow, $ only
$ hledger-bar type:al not:tag:clopen cur:\\$    # monthly net worth change ($)
$ hledger-bar type:rx --invert cur:\\$          # monthly profit/loss ($)
$ hledger-bar type:rx --invert cur:\\$ --infer-market-prices --value=then,$
   # monthly profit/loss ($, plus anything that can be converted to $,
   # using conversion rates on transaction dates)
$ hledger-bar . cur:\\$                         # all accounts' change ($)
$ hledger bar -- . cur:\\\\$                    # as hledger subcommand
