     --valuechange          calculation mode: show total change of value of
                            period-end historical balances (caused by deposits,
                            withdrawals, market price fluctuations)
     --gain                 calculation mode: show unrealised capital
                            gain/loss (historical balance value minus cost
                            basis)
     --count                calculation mode: show the count of postings
     --change               accumulation mode: accumulate amounts from column
                            start to column end (in multicolumn reports)
     --cumulative           accumulation mode: accumulate amounts from report
                            start (specified by e.g. -b/--begin) to column end

  -l --flat                 list/tree mode: show accounts as a flat list
                            (default). Amounts exclude subaccount amounts,
                            except where the account is depth-clipped.
  -t --tree                 list/tree mode: show accounts as a tree. Amounts
                            include subaccount amounts.
     --drop=N               in list mode, omit N leading account name parts
     --declared             include non-parent declared accounts (best used
                            with -E)
  -A --average              show a row average column (in multicolumn
                            reports)
  -T --row-total            show a row total column (in multicolumn reports)
     --summary-only         display only row summaries (e.g. row total,
                            average) (in multicolumn reports)
  -N --no-total             omit the final total row
     --no-elide             in tree mode, don't squash boring parent accounts
     --format=FORMATSTR     use this custom line format (in simple reports)
  -S --sort-amount          sort by amount instead of account code/name
  -% --percent              express values in percentage of each column's
                            total
     --layout=ARG           how to show multi-commodity amounts:
                            'wide[,WIDTH]': all commodities on one line
                            'tall'        : each commodity on a new line
                            'bare'        : bare numbers, symbols in a column
     --base-url=URLPREFIX   in html output, generate hyperlinks to
                            hledger-web, with this prefix. (Usually the base
                            url shown by hledger-web; can also be relative.)
  -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                            txt, html, csv, tsv, json.
  -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                            one of the above formats selects that format.

This report shows accounts declared with the Asset, Cash, Liability or
Equity type (see account types). Or if no such accounts are declared, it
shows top-level accounts named asset, liability or equity (case
insensitive, plurals allowed) and their subaccounts.

Example:

$ hledger balancesheetequity

This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and
supports many of that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
It is similar to hledger balance -H assets liabilities equity, but with
smarter account detection, and liabilities/equity displayed with their
sign flipped.

This report is the easiest way to see if the accounting equation (A+L+E
= 0) is satisfied (after you have done a close --retain to merge
revenues and expenses with equity, and perhaps added --infer-equity to
balance your commodity conversions).

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv, html, and json.
