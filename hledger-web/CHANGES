# 1.0.1 (2016/10/27)

- allow megaparsec 5.0 or 5.1


# 1.0 (2016/10/26)

## ui

-   use full width on large screens, hide sidebar on small screens, more standard bootstrap styling (#418, #422) (Dominik Süß)

-   show the sidebar by default (#310)

-   fix the add link's tooltip

-   when the add form opens, focus the first field (#338)

-   leave the add form's date field blank, avoiding a problem with tab clearing it (#322)

-   use transaction id instead of date in transaction urls (#308) (Thomas R. Koll)

-   after following a link to a transaction, highlight it (Thomas R. Koll)

-   misc. HTML/CSS/file cleanups/fixes (Thomas R. Koll)

## misc

-   startup is more robust (#226).

    Now we exit if something is already using the specified port,
    and we don't open a browser page before the app is ready.

-   termination is more robust, avoiding stray background threads.

    We terminate the server thread more carefully on exit, eg on control-C in GHCI.

-   more robust register dates and filtering in some situations (see hledger-ui notes)

-   reloading the journal preserves options, arguments in effect (#314).

    The initial query specified by command line arguments is now preserved
    when the journal is reloaded. This does not appear in the web UI, it's
    like an invisible extra filter.

-   show a proper not found page on 404

-   document the special \`inacct:\` query (#390)




0.27 (2015/10/30)

- Fix keyboard shortcut for adding a transaction (Carlos Lopez-Camey)

- Clear the form when clicking 'Add a transaction' (just like the shortcut) (Carlos Lopez-Camey)

- Disallow -f- (reading from standard input) which currently doesn't work (#202)

- Fix broken links when using --base-url (#235)

- Fix the --file-url option (#285)

- Show fewer "other accounts" in the account register: to reduce
  clutter in the "other accounts" field, if there are both real and
  virtual postings to other accounts, show only the accounts posted to
  by real postings.


0.26 (2015/7/12)

- make the j keybinding respect --base-url (fixes #271)
- respect command line options (fixes #225)
- include the unminified jquery source again (#161)
- fix build breakage from #165 (fixes #268)
- fix a js error breaking add form in browsers other than firefox (#251, Carlos Lopez-Camey <c.lopez@kmels.net>)
- drop deprecated network-conduit dependency

0.25 (2015/4/7)

- GHC 7.10 compatibility (#239)

- fix the add form when there are included files (#234)

    NB to make this work, the add form now shows the full file path of
    the main and included journal files.

- improve add form validation (#223, #234)
    
    All add form errors are displayed as form errors, not internal
    server errors, and when there are errors the add form is redisplayed
    (form inputs are not preserved, currently).

- keep the add button right-aligned when pressing ctrl - on the add form

0.24.1 (2015/1/10)

- add missing modules to fix cabal tests (#232)
