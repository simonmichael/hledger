{-|

A 'Transaction' represents a movement of some commodity(ies) between two
or more accounts. It consists of multiple account 'Posting's which balance
to zero, a date, and optional extras like description, cleared status, and
tags.

Render a journal transaction as text in the style of Ledger's print command. 

Ledger 2.x's standard format looks like this:

@
yyyy/mm/dd[ *][ CODE] description.........          [  ; comment...............]
    account name 1.....................  ...$amount1[  ; comment...............]
    account name 2.....................  ..$-amount1[  ; comment...............]

pcodewidth    = no limit -- 10          -- mimicking ledger layout.
pdescwidth    = no limit -- 20          -- I don't remember what these mean,
pacctwidth    = 35 minimum, no maximum  -- they were important at the time.
pamtwidth     = 11
pcommentwidth = no limit -- 22
@

The output will be parseable journal syntax.
To facilitate this, postings with explicit multi-commodity amounts 
are displayed as multiple similar postings, one per commodity.
(Normally does not happen with this function).

If there are multiple postings, all with explicit amounts,
and the transaction appears obviously balanced
(postings sum to 0, without needing to infer conversion prices),
the last posting's amount will not be shown.

-- | Infer prices for this transaction's posting amounts, if needed to make
-- the postings balance, and if possible. This is done once for the real
-- postings and again (separately) for the balanced virtual postings. When
-- it's not possible, the transaction is left unchanged.
--
-- The simplest example is a transaction with two postings, each in a
-- different commodity, with no prices specified. In this case we'll add a
-- price to the first posting such that it can be converted to the commodity
-- of the second posting (with -B), and such that the postings balance.
--
-- In general, we can infer a conversion price when the sum of posting amounts
-- contains exactly two different commodities and no explicit prices.  Also
-- all postings are expected to contain an explicit amount (no missing
-- amounts) in a single commodity. Otherwise no price inferring is attempted.
--
-- The transaction itself could contain more than two commodities, and/or
-- prices, if they cancel out; what matters is that the sum of posting amounts
-- contains exactly two commodities and zero prices.
--
-- There can also be more than two postings in either of the commodities.
--
-- We want to avoid excessive display of digits when the calculated price is
-- an irrational number, while hopefully also ensuring the displayed numbers
-- make sense if the user does a manual calculation. This is (mostly) achieved
-- in two ways:
--
-- - when there is only one posting in the "from" commodity, a total price
--   (@@) is used, and all available decimal digits are shown
--
-- - otherwise, a suitable averaged unit price (@) is applied to the relevant
--   postings, with display precision equal to the summed display precisions
--   of the two commodities being converted between, or 2, whichever is larger.
--
-- (We don't always calculate a good-looking display precision for unit prices
-- when the commodity display precisions are low, eg when a journal doesn't
-- use any decimal places. The minimum of 2 helps make the prices shown by the
-- print command a bit less surprising in this case. Could do better.)
