User-visible changes in hledger and hledger-lib.


0.27 (2015/10/30)

Account aliases:

- Regular expression account aliases are now fast enough that you can
  use lots of them without slowing things down. They now take
  O(aliases x accounts) time, instead of O(aliases x transactions);
  also, regular expressions are no longer recompiled unnecessarily.

Documentation:

- The hledger packages now have man pages, based on the current user
  manual, thanks to the mighty pandoc (#282).
 
Journal format:

- Dates must now begin with a digit (not /, eg).

- The comment directive longer requires an end comment, and will
  extend to the end of the file(s) without it.

Command-line interface:

- Output (balance reports, register reports, print output etc.)
  containing wide characters, eg chinese/japanese/korean characters,
  should now align correctly, when viewed in apps and fonts that show
  wide characters as double width (#242).
 
- The argument for --depth or depth: must now be positive.

add:

- Journal entries are now written with all amounts explicit, to avoid
  losing price info (#283).

- Fixed a bug which sometimes (when the same letter pair was repeated)
  caused it not to pick the most similar past transaction for defaults.
    
balance:

- There is now a -V/--value flag to report current market value (as in Ledger).
  It converts all reported amounts using their "default market price".
  "Market price" is the new name for "historical prices", defined with the P directive.
  The default market price for a commodity is the most recent one found in the journal on or before the report end date.
    
    Unlike Ledger, hledger's -V uses only the market prices recorded
  with P directives; it does not use the "transaction prices"
  recorded as part of posting amounts (which are used by -B/--cost).
  Also, using both -B and -V at the same time is supported.

- Fixed a bug in amount normalization which caused amount styles
  (commodity symbol placement, decimal point character, etc.) to be
  lost in certain cases (#230, #276).

- The balance command's --format option can now adjust the rendering
  style of multi-commodity amounts, if you begin the format string
  with one of:
    
     %_  - renders amounts on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)
     %^  - renders amounts on multiple lines, top-aligned
     %,  - renders amounts on one line, comma-separated
    
- The balance report's final total (and the line above it) now adapt
  themselves to a custom --format.

print:

- The --match option prints the journal entry that best matches a
  description (ie whose description field is most similar to the value
  given, and if there are several equally similar, the most recent).
  This was originally an add-on I used to guess account names for
  ledger-autosync. It's nice for quickly looking up a recent
  transaction from a guessed or partial description.

- print now always right-aligns the amounts in an entry, even when
  they are wider than 12 characters.  (If there is a price, it's
  considered part of the amount for right-alignment.)

register:

- Amount columns now resize automatically, using more space if it's
  needed and available.


0.26 (2015/7/12)

Account aliases:

- Account aliases are once again non-regular-expression-based, by default. (#252)
    
    The regex account aliases added in 0.24 trip up people switching between
    hledger and Ledger. (Also they are currently slow).
    
    This change makes the old non-regex aliases the default; they are
    unsurprising, useful, and pretty close in functionality to Ledger's.
    
    The new regex aliases are still available; they must be enclosed
    in forward slashes. (Ledger effectively ignores these.)
    
Journal format:

- We now parse, and also print, journal entries with no postings, as
  proposed on the mail lists.  These are not well-formed General
  Journal entries/transactions, but here is my rationale:
    
    - Ledger and beancount parse them
    - if they are parsed, they should be printed
    - they provide a convenient way to record (and report) non-transaction events
    - they permit more gradual introduction and learning of the concepts.
      So eg a beginner can keep a simple journal before learning about accounts and postings.

- Trailing whitespace after a `comment` directive is now ignored.

Command-line interface:

- The -f/file option may now be used multiple times. 
  This is equivalent to concatenating the input files before running hledger.
  The add command adds entries to the first file specified.

Queries:

- real: (no argument) is now a synonym for real:1

- tag: now matches tag names with a regular expression, like most other queries

- empty: is no longer supported, as it overlaps a bit confusingly with
  amt:0. The --empty flag is still available.

- You can now match on pending status (#250)
    
    A transaction/posting status of ! (pending) was effectively equivalent
    to * (cleared). Now it's a separate state, not matched by --cleared.
    The new Ledger-compatible --pending flag matches it, and so does
    --uncleared.

    The relevant search query terms are now status:*, status:! and
    status: (the old status:1 and status:0 spellings are deprecated).
    
    Since we interpret --uncleared and status: as "any state except cleared",
    it's not currently possible to match things which are neither cleared
    nor pending.

activity:
- activity no longer excludes 0-amount postings by default.

add:
- Don't show quotes around the journal file path in the "Creating..."
  message, for consistency with the subsequent "Adding..." message.

balancesheet:
- Accounts beginning with "debt" or now also recognised as liabilities.

print:
- We now limit the display precision of inferred prices. (#262)
    
    When a transaction posts to two commodities without specifying the
    conversion price, we generate a price which makes it balance (cf
    http://hledger.org/manual.html#prices). The print command showed
    this with full precision (so that manual calculations with the
    displayed numbers would look right), but this sometimes meant we
    showed 255 digits (when there are multiple postings in the
    commodity being priced, and the averaged unit price is an
    irrational number). In this case we now set the price's display
    precision to the sum of the (max) display precisions of the
    commodities involved. An example:
    
    hledgerdev -f- print
    <<<
    1/1
        c    C 10.00
        c    C 11.00
        d  D -320.00
    >>>
    2015/01/01
        c  C 10.00 @ D 15.2381
        c  C 11.00 @ D 15.2381
        d     D -320.00
    
    >>>=0
    
    There might still be cases where this will show more price decimal
    places than necessary. 

- We now show inferred unit prices with at least 2 decimal places.
    
    When inferring prices, if the commodities involved have low
    display precisions, we don't do a good job of rendering
    accurate-looking unit prices. Eg if the journal doesn't use any
    decimal places, any inferred unit prices are also displayed with
    no decimal places, which makes them look wrong to the user.  Now,
    we always give inferred unit prices a minimum display precision of
    2, which helps a bit.

register:
- Postings with no amounts could give a runtime error in some obscure case, now fixed.

stats: 
- stats now supports -o/--outputfile, like register/balance/print.
- An O(n^2) performance slowdown has been fixed, it's now much faster on large journals.

      +--------------------------------------++--------+--------+

Miscellaneous:

- The June 30 day span was not being rendered correctly; fixed. (#272)

- The bench script invoked by "cabal bench" or "stack bench" now runs
  some simple benchmarks.
    
    You can get more accurate benchmark times by running with --criterion.
    This will usually give much the same numbers and takes much longer.
    
    Or with --simplebench, it benchmarks whatever commands are
    configured in bench/default.bench. This mode uses the first
    "hledger" executable in $PATH.

- The deprecated shakespeare-text dependency has been removed more thoroughly.


0.25.1 (2015/4/29)

- timelog: support the description field (#247)


0.25 (2015/4/7)

- GHC 7.10 compatibility (#239)

- build with terminfo support on POSIX systems by default
    
    On non-windows systems, we now build with terminfo support by
    default, useful for detecting terminal width and other things.

    This requires the C curses dev libaries, which makes POSIX
    installation slightly harder; if it causes problems you can
    disable terminfo support with the new `curses` cabal flag, eg:
    cabal install -f-curses ... (or cabal might try this
    automatically, I'm not sure).

- register: use the full terminal width, respect COLUMNS, allow column width adjustment
    
    On POSIX systems, register now uses the full terminal width by
    default. Specifically, the output width is set from:
    
    1. a --width option
    2. or a COLUMNS environment variable (NB: not the same as a bash shell var)
    3. or on POSIX (non-windows) systems, the current terminal width
    4. or the default, 80 characters.
    
    Also, register's --width option now accepts an optional
    description column width following the overall width (--width
    WIDTH[,DESCWIDTH]). This also sets the account column width, since
    the available space (WIDTH-41) is divided up between these two
    columns. Here's a diagram:
    
    <--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
    date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
    DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA
    
    Examples:
    $ hledger reg                 # use terminal width on posix
    $ hledger reg -w 100          # width 100, equal description/account widths
    $ hledger reg -w 100,40       # width 100, wider description
    $ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,100 # terminal width and set description width

- balance: new -T/--row-total and -A/--average options

  In multicolumn balance reports, -T/--row-total now shows a row totals
  column and -A/--average shows a row averages column.
  This helps eg to see monthly average expenses (hledger bal ^expenses -MA).

  NB our use of -T deviates from Ledger's UI, where -T sets a custom
  final total expression.

- balance: -N is now short for --no-total
- balance: fix partially-visible totals row with --no-total
    
    A periodic (not using --cumulative or --historical) balance report
    with --no-total now hides the totals row properly.

- journal, csv: comment lines can also start with *
    
    As in Ledger. This means you can embed emacs org/outline-mode nodes in
    your journal file and manipulate it like an outline.

0.24.1 (2015/3/15)

- journal: fix balance accumulation across assertions (#195)
    
    A sequence of balance assertions asserting first one commodity, then
    another, then the first again, was not working.

- timelog: show hours with two decimal places instead of one (#237)
- in weekly reports, simplify week 52's heading like the others
- disallow trailing garbage in a number of parsers

    Trailing garbage is no longer ignored when parsing the following:
    balance --format option, register --width option, hledger-rewrite
    options, hledger add's inputs, CSV amounts, posting amounts,
    posting dates in tags.

- allow utf8-string-1 (fpco/stackage/#426)

0.24 (2014/12/25)

General:
- fix redundant compilation when cabal installing the hledger packages
- switch to Decimal for representing amounts (#118)
- report interval headings (eg in balance, register reports) are shown
  compactly when possible
- general speedups

Journal format:
- detect decimal point and digit groups more robustly (#196)
- check that transaction dates are followed by whitespace or newline
- check that dates use a consistent separator character
- balance assertions now are specific to a single commodity, like
  Ledger (#195)
- support multi-line comments using "comment", "end comment"
  directives, like Ledger

CSV format:
- reading CSV data from stdin now works better
- the rules file include directive is now relative to the current
  file's directory (#198)
- the original order of same-day transactions is now usually preserved
  (if the records appear to be in reverse date order, we reverse them
  before finally sorting by transaction date)
- CSV output is now built in to the balance, print, and register
  commands, controlled by -O/--output-format (and -o/--output-file,
  see below)

CLI:
- the --width and --debug options now require their argument (#149)
- when an option is repeated, the last value takes precedence (#219).
  This is helpful eg for customising your reporting command aliases on
  the fly.
- smart dates (used in -p/-b/-e/date:/date2:) now must use a
  consistent separator character, and must be parseable to the end
- output destination and format selection is now built in to the
  balance, print and register commands, controlled by -o/--output-file
  and -O/--output-format options. Notes:
  - -o - means stdout
  - an output file name suffix matching a supported format will also
    set the output format, unless overridden by --output-format
  - commands' supported output formats are listed in their
    command-line help. Two formats are currently available:
    txt (the default) and csv.
- balance assertions can be disabled with --ignore-assertions

Account aliases:
- all matching account aliases are now applied, not just one directive
  and one option
- account aliases now match by case insensitive regular expressions
  matching anywhere in the account name
- account aliases can replace multiple occurrences of the pattern
  within an account name
- an account alias replacement pattern can reference matched groups
  with \N

Queries:
- date:/date2: with a malformed date now reports an error instead of
  being ignored
- amt: now supports >= or <=
- clarify status: docs and behaviour; "*" is no longer a synonym for
  "1" (fixes #227)

balance:
- fix: in tree mode, --drop is ignored instead of showing empty account names
- a depth limit of 0 now shows summary items with account name "...",
  instead of an empty report (#206)
- in multicolumn balance reports, -E now also shows posting-less
  accounts with a non-zero balance during the period (in addition to
  showing leading & trailing empty columns)
- in multicolumn reports, multi-commodity amounts are rendered on one
  line for better layout (#186)
- multicolumn reports' title now includes the report span

register:
- runs faster with large output
- supports date2:, and date:/date2: combined with --date2, better (fixes
  #201, #221, #222)
- a depth limit of 0 now shows summary items (see balance)
- -A/--average now implies -E/--empty
- postings with multi-commodity amounts are now top-aligned, like
  Ledger

Extra commands:
- hledger-equity: fix end date in title; print closing entry too
- hledger-check-dates: added

0.23.3 (2014/9/12)

- allow text 1.2+ (#207)

0.23.2 (2014/5/8)

- register: also fix date sorting of postings (#184)

0.23.1 (2014/5/7)

- register: fix a refactoring-related regression that the tests
  missed: if transactions were not ordered by date in the journal,
  register could include postings before the report start date in the
  output. (#184)
- add: don't apply a default commodity to amounts on entry (#138)
- cli: options before the add-on command name are now also passed to it (#182)
- csv: allow the first name in a fields list to be empty (#178)
- csv: don't validate fields count in skipped lines (#177)


0.23 (2014/5/1)

Journal format:
- A # (hash) in column 0 is now also supported for starting a top-level journal comment, like Ledger.
- The "too many missing amounts" error now reminds about the 2-space rule.
- Fix: . (period) is no longer parsed as a valid amount.
- Fix: default commodity directives no longer limit the maximum display precision (#169).
- Fix: + before an amount is no longer parsed as part of the commodity (#181).

CLI:
- Command-line help cleanups, layout improvements.
- Descriptions are shown for known add-ons in the command list.
- Command aliases have been simplified.
- Add-ons can now have any of these file extensions:
  none, hs, lhs, pl, py, rb, rkt, sh, bat, com, exe.
- Add-ons are displayed without their file extensions when possible.
- Add-ons with the same name as a built-in command or alias are ignored.
- Fix: add-on detection and invocation now works on windows.
- Fix: add-ons with digits in the name are now found.
- Fix: add-on arguments containing a single quote now work.
- Fix: when -- is used to hide add-on options from the main program,
  it is no longer passed through as an add-on argument.

Queries:
- The currency/commodity query prefix (sym:) has been renamed to cur:.
- Currency/commodity queries are applied more strongly in register and
  balance reports, filtering out unwanted currencies entirely. Eg
  hledger balance cur:'\$' now reports only the dollar amounts even if
  there are multi-currency transactions or postings.
- Amount queries like amt:N, amt:<N and amt:>N, where N is not 0, now do an unsigned
  comparison of the amount and N. That is, they compare the absolute magnitude.
  To do a signed comparison instead, write N with its sign (eg amt:+N, amt:<+N, amt:>-N).
- Fix: amount queries no longer give false positives on multi-commodity amounts.

accounts:
- An accounts command has been added, similar to Ledger's, for listing account names
  in flat or hierarchical mode.

add:
- Tab completion now works at all prompts, and will insert the default if the input area is empty.
- Account and amount defaults are more robust and useful.
- Transactions may also be completed by the enter key, when there are no more default postings.
- Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when supported.

balance:
- Balance reports in flat mode now always show exclusive (subaccount-excluding) balances.
- Balance reports in flat mode with --depth now aggregate deeper accounts at the depth limit instead of excluding them.
- Multicolumn reports in flat mode now support --drop.
- Multicolumn balance reports can now show the account hierarchy with --tree.
- Multicolumn report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed
  report periods, so the first and last periods are "full" and comparable to the others.
- Fix: zero-balance leaf accounts below a non-zero-balance parent are no longer always shown (#170).
- Fix: multicolumn reports now support --date2 (cf #174).

balancesheet, cashflow, incomestatement:
- These commands now support --flat and --drop.

print:
- Tag queries (tag:) will now match a transaction if any of its postings match.

register:
- The --display option has been dropped. To see an accurate running total which
  includes the prior starting balance, use --historical/-H (like balance). 
- With a report interval, report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed
  periods, so the first and last periods are "full" and comparable to the others.
- Fix: --date2 now works with report intervals (fixes #174).

Miscellaneous:
- Default report dates now derive from the secondary dates when --date2 is in effect.
- Default report dates now notice any posting dates outside the transaction dates' span.
- Debug output improvements.
- New add-on example: extra/hledger-rewrite.hs, adds postings to matched entries.
- Compatible with GHC 7.2 (#155) - GHC 7.8, shakespeare 2


0.22.2 (2014/4/16)

- display years before 1000 with four digits, not three
- avoid pretty-show to build with GHC < 7.4
- allow text 1.1, drop data-pprint to build with GHC 7.8.x


0.22.1 (2014/1/6) and older: see http://hledger.org/release-notes or doc/release-notes.md.
