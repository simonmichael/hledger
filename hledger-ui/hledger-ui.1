hledger-ui - robust, friendly plain text accounting (TUI version)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[V]hledger-ui [OPTIONS] [QUERYARGS]\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[V]hledger ui -- [OPTIONS] [QUERYARGS]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual is for hledger\[aq]s terminal interface, version 1.28.99.
See also the hledger manual for common concepts and file formats.
.PP
hledger is a robust, user-friendly, cross-platform set of programs for
tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry
accounting and a simple, editable file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1), and
largely interconvertible with beancount(1).
.PP
hledger-ui is hledger\[aq]s terminal interface, providing an efficient
full-window text UI for viewing accounts and transactions, and some
limited data entry capability.
It is easier than hledger\[aq]s command-line interface, and sometimes
quicker and more convenient than the web interface.
.PP
Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format.
The default file is \f[V].hledger.journal\f[R] in your home directory;
this can be overridden with one or more \f[V]-f FILE\f[R] options, or
the \f[V]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] environment variable.
For more about this see hledger(1), hledger_journal(5) etc.
.PP
Unlike hledger, hledger-ui hides all future-dated transactions by
default.
They can be revealed, along with any rule-generated periodic
transactions, by pressing the F key (or starting with --forecast) to
enable \[dq]forecast mode\[dq].
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Note: if invoking hledger-ui as a hledger subcommand, write \f[V]--\f[R]

\[aq]always\[aq] or \[aq]yes\[aq]: always, useful eg when piping output
into \[aq]less -R\[aq].
\[aq]never\[aq] or \[aq]no\[aq]: never.
A NO_COLOR environment variable overrides this.
.TP
\f[V]--pretty[=WHEN]\f[R]
Show prettier output, e.g.
using unicode box-drawing characters.
Accepts \[aq]yes\[aq] (the default) or \[aq]no\[aq] (\[aq]y\[aq],
\[aq]n\[aq], \[aq]always\[aq], \[aq]never\[aq] also work).
If you provide an argument you must use \[aq]=\[aq], e.g.
\[aq]--pretty=yes\[aq].
.PP
When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line, the
last one takes precedence.
.PP
Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.
.PP
hledger help options:

.TP
\f[V]--debug[=N]\f[R]
show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)
.PP
A \[at]FILE argument will be expanded to the contents of FILE, which
should contain one command line option/argument per line.
(To prevent this, insert a \f[V]--\f[R] argument before.)
.SH MOUSE
.PP
In most modern terminals, you can navigate through the screens with a
mouse or touchpad:
.IP \[bu] 2
Use mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll up and down
.IP \[bu] 2
Click on list items to go deeper
.IP \[bu] 2
Click on the left margin (column 0) to go back.
.SH KEYS
.PP
Keyboard gives more control.
.PP
\f[V]?\f[R] shows a help dialog listing all keys.
(Some of these also appear in the quick help at the bottom of each
screen.)
Press \f[V]?\f[R] again (or \f[V]ESCAPE\f[R], or \f[V]LEFT\f[R], or
\f[V]q\f[R]) to close it.
The following keys work on most screens:
.PP
The cursor keys navigate: \f[V]RIGHT\f[R] or \f[V]ENTER\f[R] goes
deeper, \f[V]LEFT\f[R] returns to the previous screen,
\f[V]UP\f[R]/\f[V]DOWN\f[R]/\f[V]PGUP\f[R]/\f[V]PGDN\f[R]/\f[V]HOME\f[R]/\f[V]END\f[R]
move up and down through lists.
Emacs-style
(\f[V]CTRL-p\f[R]/\f[V]CTRL-n\f[R]/\f[V]CTRL-f\f[R]/\f[V]CTRL-b\f[R])
and VI-style (\f[V]k\f[R],\f[V]j\f[R],\f[V]l\f[R],\f[V]h\f[R]) movement
keys are also supported.
A tip: movement speed is limited by your keyboard repeat rate, to move
faster you may want to adjust it.
(If you\[aq]re on a mac, the karabiner app is one way to do that.)
.PP
With shift pressed, the cursor keys adjust the report period, limiting
the transactions to be shown (by default, all are shown).
\f[V]SHIFT-DOWN/UP\f[R] steps downward and upward through these standard
report period durations: year, quarter, month, week, day.
Then, \f[V]SHIFT-LEFT/RIGHT\f[R] moves to the previous/next period.
\f[V]T\f[R] sets the report period to today.
With the \f[V]-w/--watch\f[R] option, when viewing a \[dq]current\[dq]
period (the current day, week, month, quarter, or year), the period will
move automatically to track the current date.
To set a non-standard period, you can use \f[V]/\f[R] and a
\f[V]date:\f[R] query.
.PP
(Mac users: SHIFT-DOWN/UP keys do not work by default in Terminal, as of
MacOS Monterey.
You can configure them as follows: open Terminal, press CMD-comma to
open preferences, click Profiles, select your current terminal profile
on the left, click Keyboard on the right, click + and add this for
Shift-Down: \f[V]\[rs]033[1;2B\f[R], click + and add this for Shift-Up:
\f[V]\[rs]033[1;2A\f[R].
Press the Escape key to enter the \f[V]\[rs]033\f[R] part, you can\[aq]t
type it directly.)
.PP
\f[V]/\f[R] lets you set a general filter query limiting the data shown,
using the same query terms as in hledger and hledger-web.
While editing the query, you can use CTRL-a/e/d/k, BS, cursor keys;
press \f[V]ENTER\f[R] to set it, or \f[V]ESCAPE\f[R]to cancel.
There are also keys for quickly adjusting some common filters like
account depth and transaction status (see below).
\f[V]BACKSPACE\f[R] or \f[V]DELETE\f[R] removes all filters, showing all
transactions.
.PP
As mentioned above, by default hledger-ui hides future transactions -
both ordinary transactions recorded in the journal, and periodic
transactions generated by rule.
\f[V]F\f[R] toggles forecast mode, in which future/forecasted
transactions are shown.
.PP
\f[V]ESCAPE\f[R] resets the UI state and jumps back to the top screen,
restoring the app\[aq]s initial state at startup.
Or, it cancels minibuffer data entry or the help dialog.
.PP
\f[V]CTRL-l\f[R] redraws the screen and centers the selection if
possible (selections near the top won\[aq]t be centered, since we
don\[aq]t scroll above the top).
.PP
\f[V]g\f[R] reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen
and any previous screens.
(With large files, this could cause a noticeable pause.)
.PP
\f[V]I\f[R] toggles balance assertion checking.
Disabling balance assertions temporarily can be useful for
troubleshooting.
.PP
\f[V]a\f[R] runs command-line hledger\[aq]s add command, and reloads the
updated file.
This allows some basic data entry.
.PP
\f[V]A\f[R] is like \f[V]a\f[R], but runs the hledger-iadd tool, which
provides a terminal interface.
This key will be available if \f[V]hledger-iadd\f[R] is installed in
$path.
.PP
\f[V]E\f[R] runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR, or $EDITOR, or a default
(\f[V]emacsclient -a \[dq]\[dq] -nw\f[R]) on the journal file.
With some editors (emacs, vi), the cursor will be positioned at the
current transaction when invoked from the register and transaction
screens, and at the error location (if possible) when invoked from the
error screen.
.PP
\f[V]B\f[R] toggles cost mode, showing amounts in their cost\[aq]s
commodity (like toggling the \f[V]-B/--cost\f[R] flag).
.PP
\f[V]V\f[R] toggles value mode, showing amounts\[aq] current market
value in their default valuation commodity (like toggling the
\f[V]-V/--market\f[R] flag).
Note, \[dq]current market value\[dq] means the value on the report end
date if specified, otherwise today.
To see the value on another date, you can temporarily set that as the
report end date.
Eg: to see a transaction as it was valued on july 30, go to the accounts
or register screen, press \f[V]/\f[R], and add \f[V]date:-7/30\f[R] to
the query.
.PP
At most one of cost or value mode can be active at once.
.PP
There\[aq]s not yet any visual reminder when cost or value mode is
active; for now pressing \f[V]b\f[R] \f[V]b\f[R] \f[V]v\f[R] should
reliably reset to normal mode.
.PP
\f[V]q\f[R] quits the application.
.PP
Additional screen-specific keys are described below.
.SH SCREENS
.PP
hledger-ui shows several different screens, described below.
It shows the \[dq]Balance sheet accounts\[dq] screen to start with,
except in the following situations:
.IP \[bu] 2
If no asset/liability/equity accounts can be detected, or if an account
query has been given on the command line, it starts in the \[dq]All
accounts\[dq] screen.
.IP \[bu] 2
If a starting screen is specified with --menu/--all/--bs/--is/--register
on the command line, it starts in that screen.
.PP
From any screen you can press \f[V]LEFT\f[R] or \f[V]ESC\f[R] to
navigate back to the top level \[dq]Menu\[dq] screen.
.SS Menu
.PP
The top-most screen.
From here you can navigate to three accounts screens:
.SS All accounts
.PP
This screen shows all accounts (possibly filtered by a query), and their
end balances on the date shown in the title bar (or their balance
changes in the period shown in the title bar, toggleable with
\f[V]H\f[R]).
It is like the \f[V]hledger balance\f[R] command.
.SS Balance sheet accounts
.PP
This screen shows asset, liability and equity accounts, if these can be
detected (see account types).
It always shows end balances.
It is like the \f[V]hledger balancesheetequity\f[R] command.
.SS Income statement accounts
.PP
This screen shows revenue and expense accounts.
It always shows balance changes.
It is like the \f[V]hledger incomestatement\f[R] command.
.PP
All of these accounts screens work in much the same way:
.PP
They show accounts which have been posted to by transactions, as well as
accounts which have been declared with an account directive (except for
empty parent accounts).
.PP
If you specify a query on the command line or with \f[V]/\f[R] in the
app, they show just the matched accounts, and the balances from matched
transactions.
.PP
hledger-ui shows accounts with zero balances by default (unlike
command-line hledger).
To hide these, press \f[V]z\f[R] to toggle nonzero mode.
.PP
Account names are shown as a flat list by default; press \f[V]t\f[R] to
toggle tree mode.
In list mode, account balances are exclusive of subaccounts, except
where subaccounts are hidden by a depth limit (see below).
In tree mode, all account balances are inclusive of subaccounts.
.PP
To see less detail, press a number key, \f[V]1\f[R] to \f[V]9\f[R], to
set a depth limit.
Or use \f[V]-\f[R] to decrease and \f[V]+\f[R]/\f[V]=\f[R] to increase
the depth limit.
\f[V]0\f[R] shows even less detail, collapsing all accounts to a single
total.
To remove the depth limit, set it higher than the maximum account depth,
or press \f[V]ESCAPE\f[R].
.PP
\f[V]H\f[R] toggles between showing historical balances or period
balances (on the \[dq]All accounts\[dq] screen).
Historical balances (the default) are ending balances at the end of the
report period, taking into account all transactions before that date
(filtered by the filter query if any), including transactions before the
start of the report period.
In other words, historical balances are what you would see on a bank
statement for that account (unless disturbed by a filter query).
Period balances ignore transactions before the report start date, so
they show the change in balance during the report period.
They are more useful eg when viewing a time log.
.PP
\f[V]U\f[R] toggles filtering by unmarked status, including or excluding
unmarked postings in the balances.
Similarly, \f[V]P\f[R] toggles pending postings, and \f[V]C\f[R] toggles
cleared postings.
(By default, balances include all postings; if you activate one or two
status filters, only those postings are included; and if you activate
all three, the filter is removed.)
.PP
\f[V]R\f[R] toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.
.PP
Press \f[V]RIGHT\f[R] to view an account\[aq]s register screen, Or,
\f[V]LEFT\f[R] to see the menu screen.
.SS Register
.PP
This screen shows the transactions affecting a particular account, like
a check register.
Each line represents one transaction and shows:
.IP \[bu] 2
the other account(s) involved, in abbreviated form.
(If there are both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts
affected by real postings.)
.IP \[bu] 2
the overall change to the current account\[aq]s balance; positive for an
inflow to this account, negative for an outflow.
.IP \[bu] 2
the running historical total or period total for the current account,
after the transaction.
This can be toggled with \f[V]H\f[R].
Similar to the accounts screen, the historical total is affected by
transactions (filtered by the filter query) before the report start
date, while the period total is not.
If the historical total is not disturbed by a filter query, it will be
the running historical balance you would see on a bank register for the
current account.
.PP
Transactions affecting this account\[aq]s subaccounts will be included
in the register if the accounts screen is in tree mode, or if it\[aq]s
in list mode but this account has subaccounts which are not shown due to
a depth limit.
In other words, the register always shows the transactions contributing
to the balance shown on the accounts screen.
Tree mode/list mode can be toggled with \f[V]t\f[R] here also.
.PP
\f[V]U\f[R] toggles filtering by unmarked status, showing or hiding
unmarked transactions.
Similarly, \f[V]P\f[R] toggles pending transactions, and \f[V]C\f[R]
toggles cleared transactions.
(By default, transactions with all statuses are shown; if you activate
one or two status filters, only those transactions are shown; and if you
activate all three, the filter is removed.)
.PP
\f[V]R\f[R] toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.
.PP
\f[V]z\f[R] toggles nonzero mode, in which only transactions posting a
nonzero change are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command-line hledger).
.PP
Press \f[V]RIGHT\f[R] to view the selected transaction in detail.
.SS Transaction
.PP
This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger\[aq]s print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).
.PP
The transaction\[aq]s date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).
.PP
\f[V]UP\f[R] and \f[V]DOWN\f[R] will step through all transactions
listed in the previous account register screen.
In the title bar, the numbers in parentheses show your position within
that account register.
They will vary depending on which account register you came from
(remember most transactions appear in multiple account registers).
The #N number preceding them is the transaction\[aq]s position within
the complete unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least
until the next reload).
.SS Error
.PP
This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload.
Once you have fixed the problem, press g again to reload and resume
normal operation.
(Or, you can press escape to cancel the reload attempt.)
.SH TIPS
.SS Watch mode
.PP
One of hledger-ui\[aq]s best features is the auto-reloading
\f[V]-w/--watch\f[R] mode.
With this flag, it will update the display automatically whenever
changes are saved to the data files.
.PP
This is very useful when reconciling.
A good workflow is to have your bank\[aq]s online register open in a
browser window, for reference; the journal file open in an editor
window; and hledger-ui in watch mode in a terminal window, eg:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ hledger-ui --watch --register checking -C
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
As you mark things cleared in the editor, you can see the effect
immediately without having to context switch.
This leaves more mental bandwidth for your accounting.
Of course you can still interact with hledger-ui when needed, eg to
toggle cleared mode, or to explore the history.
.PP
Here are some current limitations to be aware of:
.PP
Changes might not be detected with certain editors, possibly including
Jetbrains IDEs, \f[V]gedit\f[R], other Gnome applications; or on certain
unusual filesystems.
(#1617, #911).
To work around, reload manually by pressing \f[V]g\f[R] in the
hledger-ui window.
(Or see #1617 for another workaround, and let us know if it works for
you.)
.PP
CPU and memory usage can sometimes gradually increase, if
\f[V]hledger-ui --watch\f[R] is left running for days.
(Possibly correlated with certain platforms, many transactions, and/or
large numbers of other files present).
To work around, \f[V]q\f[R]uit and restart it, or (where supported)
suspend (\f[V]CTRL-z\f[R]) and restart it (\f[V]fg\f[R]).
.SS Debug output
.PP
You can add \f[V]--debug[=N]\f[R] to the command line to log debug
output.
This will be logged to the file \f[V]hledger-ui.log\f[R] in the current
directory.
N ranges from 1 (least output, the default) to 9 (maximum output).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\f[B]COLUMNS\f[R] The screen width to use.
Default: the full terminal width.
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] The journal file path when not specified with
\f[V]-f\f[R].
.PP
On unix computers, the default value is:
\f[V]\[ti]/.hledger.journal\f[R].
.PP
A more typical value is something like
\f[V]\[ti]/finance/YYYY.journal\f[R], where \f[V]\[ti]/finance\f[R] is a
version-controlled finance directory and YYYY is the current year.
Or, \f[V]\[ti]/finance/current.journal\f[R], where current.journal is a
symbolic link to YYYY.journal.
.PP
The usual way to set this permanently is to add a command to one of your
shell\[aq]s startup files (eg \f[V]\[ti]/.profile\f[R]):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export LEDGER_FILE=\[ti]/finance/current.journal\[ga]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
On some Mac computers, there is a more thorough way to set environment
variables, that will also affect applications started from the GUI (eg,
Emacs started from a dock icon): In
\f[V]\[ti]/.MacOSX/environment.plist\f[R], add an entry like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
  \[dq]LEDGER_FILE\[dq] : \[dq]\[ti]/finance/current.journal\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
For this to take effect you might need to \f[V]killall Dock\f[R], or
reboot.
.PP
On Windows computers, the default value is probably
\f[V]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]YOURNAME\[rs].hledger.journal\f[R].
You can change this by running a command like this in a powershell
window (let us know if you need to be an Administrator, and if this
persists across a reboot):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
> setx LEDGER_FILE \[dq]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyUserName\[rs]finance\[rs]2021.journal\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or, change it in settings: see
https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html.
.SH FILES
.PP
Reads data from one or more files in journal, timeclock, timedot, or CSV
format.
The default file is \f[V].hledger.journal\f[R] in your home directory;
this can be overridden with one or more \f[V]-f FILE\f[R] options, or
the \f[V]LEDGER_FILE\f[R] environment variable.
.SH BUGS
.PP
\f[V]-f-\f[R] doesn\[aq]t work (hledger-ui can\[aq]t read from stdin).
.PP
\f[V]-V\f[R] affects only the accounts screen.
.PP
When you press \f[V]g\f[R], the current and all previous screens are
regenerated, which may cause a noticeable pause with large files.

\f[V]--watch\f[R] is not yet fully robust.
It works well for normal usage, but many file changes in a short time
(eg saving the file thousands of times with an editor macro) can cause
problems at least on OSX.
Symptoms include: unresponsive UI, periodic resetting of the cursor
position, momentary display of parse errors, high CPU usage eventually
subsiding, and possibly a small but persistent build-up of CPU usage
until the program is restarted.

Also, if you are viewing files mounted from another machine,
\f[V]-w/--watch\f[R] requires that both machine clocks are roughly in
step.
