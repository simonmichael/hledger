-- | Given a list of price directives in parse order, find the market
-- value at the given date of one unit of a given source commodity, in
-- a different specified valuation commodity, or a default valuation
-- commodity.
--
-- When the valuation commodity is specified, this looks for, in order:
--
-- - a price declaration giving the exchange rate from source
--   commodity to valuation commodity ("declared price").
--
-- - a price declaration from valuation to source commodity, which
--   gets inverted ("reverse price").
--
-- - the shortest chain of prices (declared or reverse) leading from
--   source commodity to valuation commodity, which gets collapsed
--   into a single synthetic exchange rate ("indirect price").
--
-- When the valuation commodity is not specified, this looks for the
-- latest applicable declared price, and converts to the commodity
-- mentioned in that price (the default valuation commodity).
--
-- Note this default valuation commodity can vary across successive
-- calls for different dates, since it depends on the price
-- declarations in each period.
--
-- This returns the valuation commodity that was specified or
-- inferred, and the quantity of it that one unit of the source
-- commodity is worth. Or if no applicable market price or chain of
-- prices can be found, or the source commodity and the valuation
-- commodity are the same, returns Nothing.
--
-- A 'PriceGraph' is built each time this is called, which is probably
-- wasteful when looking up multiple prices on the same day; it could
-- be built at a higher level, or memoised.
