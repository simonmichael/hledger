## Four kinds of documentation

<div style="margin:1em 2em; font-style:italic;">
"There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good
software documentation: there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation,
there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and
technical reference. They represent four different purposes or
functions, and require four different approaches to their creation."

## hledger's documentation structure

2019: out of date, needs update.

Project documentation lives in a number of places:

- `site/*.md` is the hledger.org website content, which is generated with hakyll[-std] and pandoc
- haddock documentation in the code appears on Hackage
- short blurbs: cabal files, module headers, HCAR, GSOC project, ..
- `doc/notes.org` has some old developer notes
- developer reports (profiles, benchmarks, coverage..) in doc/profs, sometimes published at hledger.org/profs
- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/doc


site/ is now a symlink to the separate hledger_site repo.

See also Shake.hs.

hledger doc files can be divided into several groups: 

1. Project admin/dev notes not published on the website.
   These are kept in this directory (doc/). They include: 
   ``` 
   doc/finance/      project finances
   doc/hcar/         Haskell Community and Activities Report entries
   doc/lib.m4        common macros used in package manuals
   doc/manpage.*     misc. templates for rendering package manuals
   doc/mockups/      exploratory developer mockups   
   doc/profs/        a place for long-term profiling/performance data
   ```
2. Project doc files required to be in the top directory:
   ```
   README.md         the main project readme, displayed on github
   LICENSE           the default project license
   ```
3. Code/API docs in haskell source files as haddock comments:
   ```
   hledger*/**/*.hs  haddock module and function docs in most source files
   ```
4. Per-package descriptions, readmes, changelogs, and reference manuals.
   These are in the respective package directories:
   ```
   hledger*/package.yaml    source for package metadata (description, etc.)
   hledger*/README          package readme, displayed on hackage
   hledger*/CHANGES         package changelog, displayed on hackage
   hledger*/hledger*.m4.md  package manual source file(s)
   ```
5. The project website and additional docs - home page, FAQ, tutorials, 
   how-tos, developer guide, etc. These are in the site directory:
   ```
   site/             hledger.org website content, templates, assets
   ```

## Workflows

The manuals and website are rendered from the top directory, 
primarily using Shake. First, build Shake:

```
$ make Shake
```

Then render the per-package manuals from markdown-m4 source files (*.m4.md) 
to text, man, info, and markdown formats. This requires some unix tools 
such as m4:

```
$ ./Shake manuals
```

The text/man/info manuals are embedded in the hledger executable, so a 
rebuild of that now will pick up the latest manuals:

```
$ stack build hledger
```

The website uses the markdown manuals. This copies them into the
website, edits them for web display, concatenates them to form the
one-page manual, and runs pandoc to render everything as html,
adding tables of contents and the site header/footer.

```
$ ./Shake website
```

They occasionally generate a lot of noise in the commit log, and I think it's a good to keep that out of the code history. The website (home and other pages, site design, site infrastructure) generates similar commit storms and is somewhat independent of code, so it goes in the soft docs repo too.
