tags
List the tags used in the journal, or their values.

_FLAGS

This command lists the tag names used in the journal, whether on
transactions, postings, or account declarations.

With a TAGREGEX argument, only tag names matching this regular
expression (case insensitive, infix matched) are shown.

With QUERY arguments, only transactions and accounts matching this query
are considered. If the query involves transaction fields (date:, desc:,
amt:, ...), the search is restricted to the matched transactions and
their accounts.

With the --values flag, the tags' unique non-empty values are listed
instead. With -E/--empty, blank/empty values are also shown.

With --parsed, tags or values are shown in the order they were parsed,
with duplicates included. (Except, tags from account declarations are
always shown first.)

Tip: remember, accounts also acquire tags from their parents, postings
also acquire tags from their account and transaction, transactions also
acquire tags from their postings.
