  [s| hledger-move
Print an entry to move funds between accounts, preserving costs and subaccounts
.
Usage: hledger-move AMT FROMACCT TOACCT
.
This command prints a journal entry which you can add to your journal,
representing a transfer of some amount from a source account (and/or
its subaccounts) to a destination account.
It is mainly intended for moving assets, especially investment assets
with subaccounts representing lots.
.
AMT is a positive hledger amount, including a commodity symbol.
.
FROMACCT is the source account (an account name, or a regular expression
whose alphanumerically first match is the source account).
.
TOACCT is the destination account (or account-matching regexp).
.
This command can also transfer from, and to, child accounts.
It will move amounts first out of FROMACCT if possible,
then as needed out of its subaccounts in alphanumerical order,
until the total requested amount is moved.
Ie, if subaccounts are named by acquisition date (eg ":YYYYMMDD"),
they will be withdrawn in FIFO order.
.
Any subaccounts withdrawn from will be recreated under TOACCT,
unless the --consolidate flag is used. With --consolidate,
all amounts are transferred to TOACCT, discarding lot information.
.
If there is not a sufficient positive balance in FROMACCT and its subaccounts
to supply the requested amount, the command will fail.
.
Examples:
.
$ hledger-move $50 assets:checking assets:cash  # withdraw cash from bank
$ hledger-move ADA1000 ada:wallet1 ada:wallet2  # move 1000 ADA, keeping lots

_FLAGS
|]
{- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:

As a convenience, no symbol means "move the account's only commodity";
this works when the source account contains just one commodity.
$ hledger-move 50 checking cash                 # the same, less typing

A zero AMT means "move all of the specified commodity".

or the keyword "all"
An "all" AMT does the same, but for all commodities present;
it works when all of the source account's commodities are positive.
$ hledger-move all savings checking               # all savings -> checking
$ hledger-move all assets:broker1:FOO assets:broker2:FOO  # move all lots

It is aware of account balances, and prevents overdraft/overpay:
it will fail if the requested transfer would make
the source account go negative (as when overdrawing an asset)
or the destination account go positive (as when over-paying a liability).
You can disable this validation by adding the --force flag.
