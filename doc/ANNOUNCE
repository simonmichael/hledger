hledger-1.50.4 fixes 1.50's journal include directive,
so that it no longer ignores paths containing dot files/directories,
and it no longer shows symbolic links dereferenced.

Best,

hledger is free, robust, friendly, multicurrency, double-entry,
plain text accounting software for unix, mac, windows, and the web.

Written in Haskell for reliability, it is built around human-readable,
version-controllable plain text files. It is inspired by and largely
compatible with Ledger CLI, and convertible to and from Beancount.
