hledger-ui(1) hledger-ui 1.16.99
********************************

hledger-ui is hledger's terminal interface, providing an efficient
full-window text UI for viewing accounts and transactions, and some
limited data entry capability.  It is easier than hledger's command-line
interface, and sometimes quicker and more convenient than the web
interface.

   Note hledger-ui has some different defaults (experimental):

   * it generates rule-based transactions and postings by default
     (-forecast and -auto are always on).
   * it hides transactions dated in the future by default (change this
     with -future or the F key).

   Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger
journal, timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or
'$LEDGER_FILE', or '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  For more about this see hledger(1),
hledger_journal(5) etc.

1 OPTIONS
*********

Note: if invoking hledger-ui as a hledger subcommand, write '--' before
options as shown above.

   Any QUERYARGS are interpreted as a hledger search query which filters
the data.

'--watch'

     watch for data and date changes and reload automatically
'--theme=default|terminal|greenterm'

     use this custom display theme
'--register=ACCTREGEX'

     start in the (first) matched account's register screen
'--change'

     show period balances (changes) at startup instead of historical
     balances
'-F --flat'

     show accounts as a list (default)
'-T --tree'

     show accounts as a tree
'--future'

     show transactions dated later than today (normally hidden)

   hledger input options:

'-f FILE --file=FILE'

     use a different input file.  For stdin, use - (default:

     Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)
'--separator=CHAR'

     Field separator to expect when reading CSV (default: ',')
'--alias=OLD=NEW'

     rename accounts named OLD to NEW
'--anon'

     anonymize accounts and payees
'--pivot FIELDNAME'

     use some other field or tag for the account name
'-I --ignore-assertions'

     disable balance assertion checks (note: does not disable balance
     assignments)

   hledger reporting options:

'-b --begin=DATE'

     include postings/txns on or after this date
'-e --end=DATE'

     include postings/txns before this date
'-D --daily'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by day
'-W --weekly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by week
'-M --monthly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by month
'-Q --quarterly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by quarter
'-Y --yearly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by year
'-p --period=PERIODEXP'

     set start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
     using period expressions syntax
'--date2'

     match the secondary date instead (see command help for other
     effects)
'-U --unmarked'

     include only unmarked postings/txns (can combine with -P or -C)
'-P --pending'

     include only pending postings/txns
'-C --cleared'

     include only cleared postings/txns
'-R --real'

     include only non-virtual postings
'-NUM --depth=NUM'

     hide/aggregate accounts or postings more than NUM levels deep
'-E --empty'

     show items with zero amount, normally hidden (and vice-versa in
     hledger-ui/hledger-web)
'-B --cost'

     convert amounts to their cost at transaction time (using the
     transaction price, if any)
'-V --value'

     convert amounts to their market value on the report end date (using
     the most recent applicable market price, if any)
'--auto'

     apply automated posting rules to modify transactions.
'--forecast'

     apply periodic transaction rules to generate future transactions,
     to 6 months from now or report end date.

   When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line,
the last one takes precedence.

   Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.

   hledger help options:

'-h --help'

     show general usage (or after COMMAND, command usage)
'--version'

     show version
'--debug[=N]'

     show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)

   A @FILE argument will be expanded to the contents of FILE, which
should contain one command line option/argument per line.  (To prevent
this, insert a '--' argument before.)

2 KEYS
******

'?' shows a help dialog listing all keys.  (Some of these also appear in
the quick help at the bottom of each screen.)  Press '?' again (or
'ESCAPE', or 'LEFT') to close it.  The following keys work on most
screens:

   The cursor keys navigate: 'right' (or 'enter') goes deeper, 'left'
returns to the previous screen, 'up'/'down'/'page up'/'page
down'/'home'/'end' move up and down through lists.  Vi-style
('h'/'j'/'k'/'l') and Emacs-style ('CTRL-p'/'CTRL-n'/'CTRL-f'/'CTRL-b')
movement keys are also supported.  A tip: movement speed is limited by
your keyboard repeat rate, to move faster you may want to adjust it.
(If you're on a mac, the Karabiner app is one way to do that.)

   With shift pressed, the cursor keys adjust the report period,
limiting the transactions to be shown (by default, all are shown).
'shift-down/up' steps downward and upward through these standard report
period durations: year, quarter, month, week, day.  Then,
'shift-left/right' moves to the previous/next period.  't' sets the
report period to today.  With the '--watch' option, when viewing a
"current" period (the current day, week, month, quarter, or year), the
period will move automatically to track the current date.  To set a
non-standard period, you can use '/' and a 'date:' query.

   '/' lets you set a general filter query limiting the data shown,
using the same query terms as in hledger and hledger-web.  While editing
the query, you can use CTRL-a/e/d/k, BS, cursor keys; press 'ENTER' to
set it, or 'ESCAPE'to cancel.  There are also keys for quickly adjusting
some common filters like account depth and transaction status (see
below).  'BACKSPACE' or 'DELETE' removes all filters, showing all
transactions.

   As mentioned above, hledger-ui shows auto-generated periodic
transactions, and hides future transactions (auto-generated or not) by
default.  'F' toggles showing and hiding these future transactions.
This is similar to using a query like 'date:-tomorrow', but more
convenient.  (experimental)

   'ESCAPE' removes all filters and jumps back to the top screen.  Or,
it cancels a minibuffer edit or help dialog in progress.

   'CTRL-l' redraws the screen and centers the selection if possible
(selections near the top won't be centered, since we don't scroll above
the top).

   'g' reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen and
any previous screens.  (With large files, this could cause a noticeable
pause.)

   'I' toggles balance assertion checking.  Disabling balance assertions
temporarily can be useful for troubleshooting.

   'a' runs command-line hledger's add command, and reloads the updated
file.  This allows some basic data entry.

   'A' is like 'a', but runs the hledger-iadd tool, which provides a
terminal interface.  This key will be available if 'hledger-iadd' is
installed in $PATH.

   'E' runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR, or $EDITOR, or a default ('emacsclient
-a "" -nw') on the journal file.  With some editors (emacs, vi), the
cursor will be positioned at the current transaction when invoked from
the register and transaction screens, and at the error location (if
possible) when invoked from the error screen.

   'q' quits the application.

   Experimental:

   'B' toggles cost mode, showing amounts in their transaction price's
commodity (like toggling the '-B/--cost' flag).

   'V' toggles value mode, showing amounts' current market value in
their default valuation commodity (like toggling the '-V/--market'
flag).  Note, "current market value" means the value on the report end
date if specified, otherwise today.  To see the value on another date,
you can temporarily set that as the report end date.  Eg: to see a
transaction as it was valued on july 30, go to the accounts or register
screen, press '/', and add 'date:-7/30' to the query.

   At most one of cost or value mode can be active at once.

   There's not yet any visual reminder when cost or value mode is
active; for now pressing 'B' 'B' 'V' should reliably reset to normal
mode.

   With -watch active, if you save an edit to the journal file while
viewing the transaction screen in cost or value mode, the 'B'/'V' keys
will stop working.  To work around, press g to force a manual reload, or
exit the transaction screen.

   Additional screen-specific keys are described below.

3 SCREENS
*********

* Menu:

* Accounts screen::
* Register screen::
* Transaction screen::
* Error screen::


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Accounts screen,  Next: Register screen,  Up: SCREENS

3.1 Accounts screen
===================

This is normally the first screen displayed.  It lists accounts and
their balances, like hledger's balance command.  By default, it shows
all accounts and their latest ending balances (including the balances of
subaccounts).  if you specify a query on the command line, it shows just
the matched accounts and the balances from matched transactions.

   Account names are shown as a flat list by default.  Press 'T' to
toggle tree mode.  In flat mode, account balances are exclusive of
subaccounts, except where subaccounts are hidden by a depth limit (see
below).  In tree mode, all account balances are inclusive of
subaccounts.

   To see less detail, press a number key, '1' to '9', to set a depth
limit.  Or use '-' to decrease and '+'/'=' to increase the depth limit.
'0' shows even less detail, collapsing all accounts to a single total.
To remove the depth limit, set it higher than the maximum account depth,
or press 'ESCAPE'.

   'H' toggles between showing historical balances or period balances.
Historical balances (the default) are ending balances at the end of the
report period, taking into account all transactions before that date
(filtered by the filter query if any), including transactions before the
start of the report period.  In other words, historical balances are
what you would see on a bank statement for that account (unless
disturbed by a filter query).  Period balances ignore transactions
before the report start date, so they show the change in balance during
the report period.  They are more useful eg when viewing a time log.

   'U' toggles filtering by unmarked status, including or excluding
unmarked postings in the balances.  Similarly, 'P' toggles pending
postings, and 'C' toggles cleared postings.  (By default, balances
include all postings; if you activate one or two status filters, only
those postings are included; and if you activate all three, the filter
is removed.)

   'R' toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

   'Z' toggles nonzero mode, in which only accounts with nonzero
balances are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command-line hledger).

   Press 'right' or 'enter' to view an account's transactions register.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Register screen,  Next: Transaction screen,  Prev: Accounts screen,  Up: SCREENS

3.2 Register screen
===================

This screen shows the transactions affecting a particular account, like
a check register.  Each line represents one transaction and shows:

   * the other account(s) involved, in abbreviated form.  (If there are
     both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts affected
     by real postings.)

   * the overall change to the current account's balance; positive for
     an inflow to this account, negative for an outflow.

   * the running historical total or period total for the current
     account, after the transaction.  This can be toggled with 'H'.
     Similar to the accounts screen, the historical total is affected by
     transactions (filtered by the filter query) before the report start
     date, while the period total is not.  If the historical total is
     not disturbed by a filter query, it will be the running historical
     balance you would see on a bank register for the current account.

   Transactions affecting this account's subaccounts will be included in
the register if the accounts screen is in tree mode, or if it's in flat
mode but this account has subaccounts which are not shown due to a depth
limit.  In other words, the register always shows the transactions
contributing to the balance shown on the accounts screen.
Tree mode/flat mode can be toggled with 'T' here also.

   'U' toggles filtering by unmarked status, showing or hiding unmarked
transactions.  Similarly, 'P' toggles pending transactions, and 'C'
toggles cleared transactions.  (By default, transactions with all
statuses are shown; if you activate one or two status filters, only
those transactions are shown; and if you activate all three, the filter
is removed.)

   'R' toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

   'Z' toggles nonzero mode, in which only transactions posting a
nonzero change are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command-line hledger).

   Press 'right' (or 'enter') to view the selected transaction in
detail.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Transaction screen,  Next: Error screen,  Prev: Register screen,  Up: SCREENS

3.3 Transaction screen
======================

This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger's print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).

   The transaction's date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).

   'up' and 'down' will step through all transactions listed in the
previous account register screen.  In the title bar, the numbers in
parentheses show your position within that account register.  They will
vary depending on which account register you came from (remember most
transactions appear in multiple account registers).  The #N number
preceding them is the transaction's position within the complete
unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least until the next
reload).

3.4 Error screen
================

This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload.  Once you have fixed the problem, press g
again to reload and resume normal operation.  (Or, you can press escape
to cancel the reload attempt.)
