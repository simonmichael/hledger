Thanks for helping to make hledger better! Here's how to make a good bug report:

1. Check:

- `hledger --version`                  it's best if it's not very old
- https://hledger.org/install.html     shows the current version and how to upgrade
- https://hledger.org/hledger.html     the manual (choose your version at top of page)
  https://hledger.org/hledger-ui.html  
  https://hledger.org/hledger-web.html
- https://hledger.org/relnotes.html    recent fixes and upgrade notes
- https://bugs.hledger.org             bugs already reported
- https://hledger.org/faq.html         answers to common questions
- https://hledger.org/support.html     if you have other questions

2. In your bug report, please include if possible:

- the output of `hledger --version` or (ideal, unless you think it's unneeded) `hledger setup`
- which operating system you're running on
- a link to the most relevant doc that you found, if any
- a small reproducible example or instructions to reproduce.

3. And remove this help text.
