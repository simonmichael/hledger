-- generate a ghc environment file, needed by doctest 
-- (eg: ./.ghc.environment.x86_64-darwin-8.8.3). 
-- cabal 3 doesn't write these by default.

-- cabal 2 doesn't understand this flag, but it's just a warning; should be ok.
-- cabal 3 still fails with doctest the first time; you have to run it
-- a second time. Hopefully in practice it won't fail, because of a
-- preceding cabal build.
