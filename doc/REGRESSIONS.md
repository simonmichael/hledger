# Regression bounty

Shortcut: [hledger.org/regressions](https://hledger.org/regressions)

A regression is "something that used to work, that broke", or "an unintended not-good change"
in a released version of hledger.

We don't like regressions. We want to detect them quickly, repair them quickly, and reduce their frequency.
You can help by finding them, or fixing them! 

## Regression finder bounty

For new regression reports submitted to the bug tracker since 2024-01-01 (affecting any past release), we currently offer a $50 bounty
([original announcement](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1570)).
If you don't want the bounty, you can absolutely choose to re-donate it back to the project treasury.
But consider accepting it - it's good for the project!
Just do respond within 7 days after the bounty is confirmed, otherwise it will become an automatic project donation.

## Regression fixer bounty

For regression issues fixed, we currently offer a separate $50 bounty.
If you find and fix the regression, you get both bounties. 
(If you caused the regression, we appreciate you fixing it but you don't get the bounties - sorry!)

## How to claim the bounty

1. Discover a new regression, which you did not cause, and report it in the [hledger bug tracker](http://bugs.hledger.org).
   And/or, fix an open issue which has the `regression` label.
2. Wait for confirmation from the issue manager ([SM](https://joyful.com)).
3. Send an expense reimbursement request to [hledger's open collective](https://opencollective.com/hledger).
   Note this might reveal your real name.
   Here's the procedure:
   - at hledger's open collective, click [Submit Expense](https://opencollective.com/hledger/expenses/new).  (If you are logged in, this will be under the ACTIONS menu.)
   - choose **Invoice**; choose a Payout method; click Next
   - Expense title: **Regression (finder / fixer / finder & fixer) bounty for #NNNN**
   - Description: **(Found / Fixed) ISSUEURL, WORKDATE(S)**
   - Date: **today's date**
   - Amount: **USD 50** (or **100** if you found and fixed).
     Or convert to another currency with today's rate (and mention that rate in Description).
   - Next, Submit Expense
5. Wait for the finance manager (SM) to get the email notification and approve it. This should not take more than a day or two.
   (For fastest response, mention on the issue page or in chat that you've submitted.)
6. Wait for Open Collective to pay it. This should happen within a week (payouts happen twice a week).
