hledger_timedot(5)
******************

Timedot is a plain text format for logging dated, categorised quantities
(eg time), supported by hledger. It is convenient for approximate and
retroactive time logging, eg when the real-time clock-in/out required
with a timeclock file is too precise or too interruptive. It can be
formatted like a bar chart, making clear at a glance where time was
spent.

   Though called "timedot", the format does not specify the commodity
being logged, so could represent other dated, quantifiable things. Eg
you could record a single-entry journal of financial transactions,
perhaps slightly more conveniently than with hledger_journal(5) format.

*************

A timedot file contains a series of day entries. A day entry begins with
a date, and is followed by category/quantity pairs, one per line. Dates
are hledger-style simple dates (see hledger_journal(5)). Categories are
hledger-style account names, optionally indented. There must be at least
two spaces between the category and the quantity. Quantities can be
written in two ways:

  1. a series of dots (period characters). Each dot represents "a
     quarter" - eg, a quarter hour. Spaces can be used to group dots
     into hours, for easier counting.

  2. a number (integer or decimal), representing "units" - eg, hours. A
     good alternative when dots are cumbersome. (A number also can
     record negative quantities.)


   Blank lines and lines beginning with #, ; or * are ignored. An
example:


# on this day, 6h was spent on client work, 1.5h on haskell FOSS work, etc.
2016/2/1
inc:client1   .... .... .... .... .... ....
fos:haskell   .... ..
biz:research  .

2016/2/2

   Or with numbers:


2016/2/3
inc:client1   4
fos:hledger   3
biz:research  1

   I prefer to use period for separating account components. We can make
this work with an account alias:


2016/2/4
fos.hledger.timedot  4
fos.ledger           ..


$ hledger -f t.timedot --alias /\\./=: bal date:2016/2/4
                4.50  fos
                4.00    hledger:timedot
                0.50    ledger
--------------------
                4.50

   Here is a sample.timedot.
