Thanks for helping to make hledger better!
For a high quality bug report, here are some good things to check first:

- Your hledger version (run `hledger --version`). It's best if it's not very old.
  https://hledger.org/install.html shows the current version and how to upgrade.

- The appropriate manual, choosing the right version at the top of the page:
  https://hledger.org/hledger.html
  https://hledger.org/hledger-ui.html
  https://hledger.org/hledger-web.html

- https://hledger.org/relnotes.html lists recent fixes and changes.

- https://bugs.hledger.org shows the bugs already reported.

- https://hledger.org/faq.html answers some common questions.

- https://hledger.org/support.html -> chat if you have questions.

In your bug report, please include if possible:

- the output of `hledger --version` or (best) `hledger setup`
- which operating system you're running on
- a link to the most relevant doc that you found, if any
- a small reproducible example or instructions to reproduce.

(And remove this boilerplate text before submitting.)
