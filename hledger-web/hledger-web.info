hledger-web - robust, friendly plain text accounting (Web version)

   'hledger-web [--serve|--serve-api] [OPTS] [ARGS]'
'hledger web -- [--serve|--serve-api] [OPTS] [ARGS]'

   This manual is for hledger's web interface, version 1.32.99.  See
also the hledger manual for common concepts and file formats.

   hledger is a robust, user-friendly, cross-platform set of programs
for tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry
accounting and a simple, editable file format.  hledger is inspired by
and largely compatible with ledger(1), and largely interconvertible with
beancount(1).

   hledger-web is a simple web application for browsing and adding
transactions.  It provides a more user-friendly UI than the hledger CLI
or hledger-ui TUI, showing more at once (accounts, the current account
register, balance charts) and allowing history-aware data entry,
interactive searching, and bookmarking.

   hledger-web also lets you share a journal with multiple users, or
even the public web.  There is no access control, so if you need that
you should put it behind a suitable web proxy.  As a small protection
against data loss when running an unprotected instance, it writes a
numbered backup of the main journal file (only) on every edit.

   Like hledger, it reads from (and appends to) a journal file specified
by the 'LEDGER_FILE' environment variable (defaulting to
'$HOME/.hledger.journal'); or you can specify files with '-f' options.
It can also read timeclock files, timedot files, or any CSV/SSV/TSV file
with a date field.  (See hledger(1) -> Input for details.)

   hledger-web can be run in three modes:

   * Transient mode (the default): your default web browser will be
     opened to show the app if possible, and the app exits automatically
     after two minutes of inactivity (no requests received and no open
     browser windows viewing it).

   * With '--serve': the app runs without stopping, and without opening
     a browser.

   * With '--serve-api': only the JSON API is served.

   In all cases hledger-web runs as a foreground process, logging
requests to stdout.

1 OPTIONS
*********

hledger-web provides the following options:

'--serve'

     serve and log requests, don't browse or auto-exit after timeout
'--serve-api'

     like -serve, but serve only the JSON web API, not the web UI
'--allow=view|add|edit'

     set the user's access level for changing data (default: 'add').  It
     also accepts 'sandstorm' for use on that platform (reads
     permissions from the 'X-Sandstorm-Permissions' request header).
'--cors=ORIGIN'

     allow cross-origin requests from the specified origin; setting
     ORIGIN to "*" allows requests from any origin
'--host=IPADDR'

     listen on this IP address (default: 127.0.0.1)

   By default the server listens on IP address '127.0.0.1', which is
accessible only to requests from the local machine..  You can use
'--host' to listen on a different address configured on the machine, eg
to allow access from other machines.  The special address '0.0.0.0'
causes it to listen on all addresses configured on the machine.

'--port=PORT'

     listen on this TCP port (default: 5000)

   Similarly, you can use '--port' to listen on a TCP port other than
5000.  This is useful if you want to run multiple hledger-web instances
on a machine.

'--socket=SOCKETFILE'

     listen on the given unix socket instead of an IP address and port
     (unix only; implies -serve)

   When '--socket' is used, hledger-web creates and communicates via a
socket file instead of a TCP port.  This can be more secure, respects
unix file permissions, and makes certain use cases easier, such as
running per-user instances behind an nginx reverse proxy.  (Eg:
'proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/hledger/${remote_user}.socket;'.)

'--base-url=URL'

     set the base url (default: http://IPADDR:PORT).

   You can use '--base-url' to change the protocol, hostname, port and
path that appear in hledger-web's hyperlinks.  This is useful eg when
integrating hledger-web within a larger website.  The default is
'http://HOST:PORT/' using the server's configured host address and TCP
port (or 'http://HOST' if PORT is 80).  Note this affects url generation
but not route parsing.

'--test'

     run hledger-web's tests and exit.  hspec test runner args may
     follow a -, eg: hledger-web -test - -help

   hledger-web also supports many of hledger's general options.  Query
options and arguments may be used to set an initial filter, which
although not shown in the UI, will restrict the data shown, in addition
to any search query entered in the UI.

     (not just forecast txns)
'--verbose-tags'

     add visible tags indicating transactions or postings which have
     been generated/modified
'--commodity-style'

     Override the commodity style in the output for the specified
     commodity.  For example 'EUR1.000,00'.
'--color=WHEN (or --colour=WHEN)'

     Should color-supporting commands use ANSI color codes in text
     output.  'auto' (default): whenever stdout seems to be a
     color-supporting terminal.  'always' or 'yes': always, useful eg
     when piping output into 'less -R'. 'never' or 'no': never.  A
     NO_COLOR environment variable overrides this.
'--pretty[=WHEN]'

     Show prettier output, e.g.  using unicode box-drawing characters.
     Accepts 'yes' (the default) or 'no' ('y', 'n', 'always', 'never'
     also work).  If you provide an argument you must use '=', e.g.
     '-pretty=yes'.

   When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line,
the last one takes precedence.

   Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.

2 PERMISSIONS
*************

By default, hledger-web allows anyone who can reach it to view the
journal and to add new transactions, but not to change existing data.

   You can restrict who can reach it by

   * setting the IP address it listens on (see '--host' above).  By
     default it listens on 127.0.0.1, accessible to all users on the
     local machine.
   * putting it behind an authenticating proxy, using eg apache or nginx
   * custom firewall rules

   You can restrict what the users who reach it can do, by

   * using the '--capabilities=CAP[,CAP..]' flag when you start it,
     enabling one or more of the following capabilities.  The default
     value is 'view,add':
        * 'view' - allows viewing the journal file and all included
          files
        * 'add' - allows adding new transactions to the main journal
          file
        * 'manage' - allows editing, uploading or downloading the main
          or included files

   * using the '--capabilities-header=HTTPHEADER' flag to specify a HTTP
     header from which it will read capabilities to enable.  hledger-web
     on Sandstorm uses the X-Sandstorm-Permissions header to integrate
     with Sandstorm's permissions.  This is disabled by default.


File: hledger-web.info,  Node: EDITING UPLOADING DOWNLOADING,  Next: RELOADING,  Prev: PERMISSIONS,  Up: Top

3 EDITING, UPLOADING, DOWNLOADING
*********************************

If you enable the 'manage' capability mentioned above, you'll see a new
"spanner" button to the right of the search form.  Clicking this will
let you edit, upload, or download the journal file or any files it
includes.

   Note, unlike any other hledger command, in this mode you (or any
visitor) can alter or wipe the data files.

   Normally whenever a file is changed in this way, hledger-web saves a
numbered backup (assuming file permissions allow it, the disk is not
full, etc.)  hledger-web is not aware of version control systems,
currently; if you use one, you'll have to arrange to commit the changes
yourself (eg with a cron job or a file watcher like entr).

   Changes which would leave the journal file(s) unparseable or
non-valid (eg with failing balance assertions) are prevented.
(Probably.  This needs re-testing.)


File: hledger-web.info,  Node: RELOADING,  Next: JSON API,  Prev: EDITING UPLOADING DOWNLOADING,  Up: Top

4 RELOADING
***********

hledger-web detects changes made to the files by other means (eg if you
edit it directly, outside of hledger-web), and it will show the new data
when you reload the page or navigate to a new page.  If a change makes a
file unparseable, hledger-web will display an error message until the
file has been fixed.

   (Note: if you are viewing files mounted from another machine, make
sure that both machine clocks are roughly in step.)


File: hledger-web.info,  Node: JSON API,  Next: DEBUG OUTPUT,  Prev: RELOADING,  Up: Top

5 JSON API
**********

In addition to the web UI, hledger-web also serves a JSON API that can
be used to get data or add new transactions.  If you want the JSON API
only, you can use the '--serve-api' flag.  Eg:

$ hledger-web -f examples/sample.journal --serve-api
...

   You can get JSON data from these routes:

/version
/accountnames
/transactions
/prices
/commodities
/accounts
/accounttransactions/ACCOUNTNAME

   Eg, all account names in the journal (similar to the accounts
command).  (hledger-web's JSON does not include newlines, here we use
python to prettify it):

$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/accountnames | python -m json.tool
[
    "assets",
    "assets:bank",
    "assets:bank:checking",
    "assets:bank:saving",
    "assets:cash",
    "expenses",
    "expenses:food",
    "expenses:supplies",
    "income",
    "income:gifts",
    "income:salary",
    "liabilities",
    "liabilities:debts"
]

   Or all transactions:

$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions | python -m json.tool
[
    {
        "tcode": "",
        "tcomment": "",
        "tdate": "2008-01-01",
        "tdate2": null,
        "tdescription": "income",
        "tindex": 1,
        "tpostings": [
            {
                "paccount": "assets:bank:checking",
                "pamount": [
                    {
                        "acommodity": "$",
                        "aismultiplier": false,
                        "aprice": null,
...

   Most of the JSON corresponds to hledger's data types; for details of
what the fields mean, see the Hledger.Data.Json haddock docs and click
on the various data types, eg Transaction.  And for a higher level
understanding, see the journal docs.

   In some cases there is outer JSON corresponding to a "Report" type.
To understand that, go to the Hledger.Web.Handler.MiscR haddock and look
at the source for the appropriate handler to see what it returns.  Eg
for '/accounttransactions' it's getAccounttransactionsR, returning a
"'accountTransactionsReport ...'".  Looking up the haddock for that we
can see that /accounttransactions returns an AccountTransactionsReport,
which consists of a report title and a list of
AccountTransactionsReportItem (etc).

   You can add a new transaction to the journal with a PUT request to
'/add', if hledger-web was started with the 'add' capability (enabled by
default).  The payload must be the full, exact JSON representation of a
hledger transaction (partial data won't do).  You can get sample JSON
from hledger-web's '/transactions' or '/accounttransactions', or you can
export it with hledger-lib, eg like so:

.../hledger$ stack ghci hledger-lib
>>> writeJsonFile "txn.json" (head $ jtxns samplejournal)
>>> :q

   Here's how it looks as of hledger-1.17 (remember, this JSON
corresponds to hledger's Transaction and related data types):

    "tcomment": "",

   And here's how to test adding it with curl.  This should add a new

================

You can add '--debug[=N]' to the command line to log debug output.  N
ranges from 1 (least output, the default) to 9 (maximum output).
Typically you would start with 1 and increase until you are seeing
enough.  Debug output goes to stderr, interleaved with the requests
logged on stdout.  To capture debug output in a log file instead, you
can usually redirect stderr, eg:
'hledger-web --debug=3 2>hledger-web.log'.
