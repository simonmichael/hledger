stats

Show journal and performance statistics.

Flags:
  -1                        show a single line of output
  -v --verbose              show more detailed output
  -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE.

The stats command shows summary information for the whole journal, or a
matched part of it. With a reporting interval, it shows a report for
each report period.

It also shows some performance statistics:

- how long the program ran for
- the number of transactions processed per second
- the peak live memory in use by the program to do its work
- the peak allocated memory as seen by the program

By default, the output is reasonably discreet; it reveals the main file
name, your activity level, and the speed of your machine.

With -v/--verbose, more details are shown: the full paths of all files,
and the names of the commodities you work with.

With -1, only one line of output is shown, in a machine-friendly
tab-separated format: the program version, the main journal file name,
and the performance stats,

The run time of stats is similar to that of a balance report.

Example:

$ hledger stats -f examples/1ktxns-1kaccts.journal 
Main file           : .../1ktxns-1kaccts.journal
Included files      : 0
Txns span           : 2000-01-01 to 2002-09-27 (1000 days)
Last txn            : 2002-09-26 (7827 days ago)
Txns                : 1000 (1.0 per day)
Txns last 30 days   : 0 (0.0 per day)
Txns last 7 days    : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions : 1000
Accounts            : 1000 (depth 10)
Commodities         : 26
Market prices       : 1000
Runtime stats       : 0.12 s elapsed, 8266 txns/s, 4 MB live, 16 MB alloc

$ hledger stats -1 -f examples/10ktxns-1kaccts.journal
1.50.99-g0835a2485-20251119, mac-aarch64    10ktxns-1kaccts.journal 0.66 s elapsed  15244 txns/s    28 MB live  86 MB alloc

This command supports the -o/--output-file option (but not
-O/--output-format).
