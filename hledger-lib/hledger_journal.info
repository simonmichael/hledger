hledger_journal(5) hledger 1.15.99
**********************************

hledger's usual data source is a plain text file containing journal
entries in hledger journal format.  This file represents a standard
accounting general journal.  I use file names ending in '.journal', but
that's not required.  The journal file contains a number of transaction
entries, each describing a transfer of money (or any commodity) between
two or more named accounts, in a simple format readable by both hledger
and humans.

   hledger's journal format is a compatible subset, mostly, of ledger's
journal format, so hledger can work with compatible ledger journal files
as well.  It's safe, and encouraged, to run both hledger and ledger on
the same journal file, eg to validate the results you're getting.

   You can use hledger without learning any more about this file; just
use the add or web commands to create and update it.  Many users,
though, also edit the journal file directly with a text editor, perhaps
assisted by the helper modes for emacs or vim.

   Here's an example:

; A sample journal file. This is a comment.

2008/01/01 income             ; <- transaction's first line starts in column 0, contains date and description
    assets:bank:checking  $1  ; <- posting lines start with whitespace, each contains an account name
    income:salary        $-1  ;    followed by at least two spaces and an amount

2008/06/01 gift
    assets:bank:checking  $1  ; <- at least two postings in a transaction
    income:gifts         $-1  ; <- their amounts must balance to 0

2008/06/02 save
    assets:bank:saving    $1
    assets:bank:checking      ; <- one amount may be omitted; here $-1 is inferred

2008/06/03 eat & shop         ; <- description can be anything
    expenses:food         $1

1.1 Transactions
================

Transactions are movements of some quantity of commodities between named
accounts.  Each transaction is represented by a journal entry beginning
with a simple date in column 0.  This can be followed by any of the
following, separated by spaces:

   * (optional) a status character (empty, '!', or '*')
   * (optional) a transaction code (any short number or text, enclosed
     in parentheses)
   * (optional) a transaction description (any remaining text until end
     of line or a semicolon)
   * (optional) a transaction comment (any remaining text following a
     semicolon until end of line)

   Then comes zero or more (but usually at least 2) indented lines
representing...


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Postings,  Next: Dates,  Prev: Transactions,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.2 Postings
============

A posting is an addition of some amount to, or removal of some amount
from, an account.  Each posting line begins with at least one space or
tab (2 or 4 spaces is common), followed by:

   * (optional) a status character (empty, '!', or '*'), followed by a
     space
   * (required) an account name (any text, optionally containing *single
     spaces*, until end of line or a double space)
   * (optional) *two or more spaces* or tabs followed by an amount.

   Positive amounts are being added to the account, negative amounts are
being removed.

   The amounts within a transaction must always sum up to zero.  As a
convenience, one amount may be left blank; it will be inferred so as to
balance the transaction.

   Be sure to note the unusual two-space delimiter between account name
and amount.  This makes it easy to write account names containing
spaces.  But if you accidentally leave only one space (or tab) before
the amount, the amount will be considered part of the account name.

1.3.1 Simple dates
------------------

Within a journal file, transaction dates use Y/M/D (or Y-M-D or Y.M.D)
Leading zeros are optional.  The year may be omitted, in which case it
will be inferred from the context - the current transaction, the default
year set with a default year directive, or the current date when the
command is run.  Some examples: '2010/01/31', '1/31', '2010-01-31',
'2010.1.31'.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Secondary dates,  Next: Posting dates,  Prev: Simple dates,  Up: Dates

1.3.2 Secondary dates
---------------------

Real-life transactions sometimes involve more than one date - eg the
date you write a cheque, and the date it clears in your bank.  When you
want to model this, eg for more accurate balances, you can specify
individual posting dates, which I recommend.  Or, you can use the
secondary dates (aka auxiliary/effective dates) feature, supported for
compatibility with Ledger.

   A secondary date can be written after the primary date, separated by
an equals sign.  The primary date, on the left, is used by default; the
secondary date, on the right, is used when the '--date2' flag is
specified ('--aux-date' or '--effective' also work).

   The meaning of secondary dates is up to you, but it's best to follow
a consistent rule.  Eg write the bank's clearing date as primary, and
when needed, the date the transaction was initiated as secondary.

   Here's an example.  Note that a secondary date will use the year of
the primary date if unspecified.

2010/2/23=2/19 movie ticket
  expenses:cinema                   $10
  assets:checking

$ hledger register checking
2010/02/23 movie ticket         assets:checking                $-10         $-10

$ hledger register checking --date2
2010/02/19 movie ticket         assets:checking                $-10         $-10

   Secondary dates require some effort; you must use them consistently
in your journal entries and remember whether to use or not use the
'--date2' flag for your reports.  They are included in hledger for
Ledger compatibility, but posting dates are a more powerful and less
confusing alternative.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Posting dates,  Prev: Secondary dates,  Up: Dates

1.3.3 Posting dates
-------------------

You can give individual postings a different date from their parent
transaction, by adding a posting comment containing a tag (see below)
like 'date:DATE'.  This is probably the best way to control posting
dates precisely.  Eg in this example the expense should appear in May
reports, and the deduction from checking should be reported on 6/1 for
easy bank reconciliation:

2015/5/30
    expenses:food     $10  ; food purchased on saturday 5/30
    assets:checking        ; bank cleared it on monday, date:6/1

$ hledger -f t.j register food
2015/05/30                      expenses:food                  $10           $10

$ hledger -f t.j register checking
2015/06/01                      assets:checking               $-10          $-10

   DATE should be a simple date; if the year is not specified it will
use the year of the transaction's date.  You can set the secondary date
similarly, with 'date2:DATE2'.  The 'date:' or 'date2:' tags must have a
valid simple date value if they are present, eg a 'date:' tag with no
value is not allowed.

   Ledger's earlier, more compact bracketed date syntax is also
supported: '[DATE]', '[DATE=DATE2]' or '[=DATE2]'.  hledger will attempt
to parse any square-bracketed sequence of the '0123456789/-.='
characters in this way.  With this syntax, DATE infers its year from the
transaction and DATE2 infers its year from DATE.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Status,  Next: Description,  Prev: Dates,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.4 Status
==========

Transactions, or individual postings within a transaction, can have a
status mark, which is a single character before the transaction
description or posting account name, separated from it by a space,
indicating one of three statuses:

mark  status
 
-----------------
      unmarked
'!'   pending
'*'   cleared

   When reporting, you can filter by status with the '-U/--unmarked',
'-P/--pending', and '-C/--cleared' flags; or the 'status:', 'status:!',
and 'status:*' queries; or the U, P, C keys in hledger-ui.

   Note, in Ledger and in older versions of hledger, the "unmarked"
state is called "uncleared".  As of hledger 1.3 we have renamed it to
unmarked for clarity.

   To replicate Ledger and old hledger's behaviour of also matching
pending, combine -U and -P.

   Status marks are optional, but can be helpful eg for reconciling with
real-world accounts.  Some editor modes provide highlighting and
shortcuts for working with status.  Eg in Emacs ledger-mode, you can
toggle transaction status with C-c C-e, or posting status with C-c C-c.

   What "uncleared", "pending", and "cleared" actually mean is up to
you.  Here's one suggestion:

status     meaning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
uncleared  recorded but not yet reconciled; needs review
pending    tentatively reconciled (if needed, eg during a big
           reconciliation)
cleared    complete, reconciled as far as possible, and considered
           correct

   With this scheme, you would use '-PC' to see the current balance at
your bank, '-U' to see things which will probably hit your bank soon
(like uncashed checks), and no flags to see the most up-to-date state of
your finances.

1.5 Description
===============

A transaction's description is the rest of the line following the date
and status mark (or until a comment begins).  Sometimes called the
"narration" in traditional bookkeeping, it can be used for whatever you
wish, or left blank.  Transaction descriptions can be queried, unlike
comments.

* Menu:

* Payee and note::


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Payee and note,  Up: Description

1.5.1 Payee and note
--------------------

You can optionally include a '|' (pipe) character in descriptions to
subdivide the description into separate fields for payee/payer name on
the left (up to the first '|') and an additional note field on the right
(after the first '|').  This may be worthwhile if you need to do more
precise querying and pivoting by payee or by note.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Account names,  Next: Amounts,  Prev: Description,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.6 Account names
=================

Account names typically have several parts separated by a full colon,
from which hledger derives a hierarchical chart of accounts.  They can
be anything you like, but in finance there are traditionally five
top-level accounts: 'assets', 'liabilities', 'income', 'expenses', and
'equity'.

   Account names may contain single spaces, eg: 'assets:accounts
receivable'.  Because of this, they must always be followed by *two or
more spaces* (or newline).

   Account names can be aliased.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Amounts,  Next: Virtual Postings,  Prev: Account names,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.7 Amounts
===========

After the account name, there is usually an amount.  (Important: between
account name and amount, there must be *two or more spaces*.)

   hledger's amount format is flexible, supporting several international
formats.  Here are some examples.  Amounts have a number (the
"quantity"):

1

   ..and usually a currency or commodity name (the "commodity").  This
is a symbol, word, or phrase, to the left or right of the quantity, with
or without a separating space:

$1
4000 AAPL

   If the commodity name contains spaces, numbers, or punctuation, it
must be enclosed in double quotes:

3 "no. 42 green apples"

   Amounts can be negative.  The minus sign can be written before or
after a left-side commodity symbol:

-$1
$-1

   Scientific E notation is allowed:

1E-6
EUR 1E3

   A decimal mark (decimal point) can be written with a period or a
comma:

1.23
1,23456780000009

* Menu:

* Digit group marks::
* Amount display format::


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Digit group marks,  Next: Amount display format,  Up: Amounts

1.7.1 Digit group marks
-----------------------

In the integer part of the quantity (left of the decimal mark), groups
of digits can optionally be separated by a "digit group mark" - a space,
comma, or period (different from the decimal mark):

     $1,000,000.00
  EUR 2.000.000,00
INR 9,99,99,999.00
      1 000 000.9455

   Note, a number containing a single group mark and no decimal mark is
ambiguous.  Are these group marks or decimal marks ?

1,000
1.000

   hledger will treat them both as decimal marks by default (cf #793).
If you use digit group marks, to prevent confusion and undetected typos
we recommend you write commodity directives at the top of the file to
explicitly declare the decimal mark (and optionally a digit group mark).
Note, these formats ("amount styles") are specific to each commodity, so
if your data uses multiple formats, hledger can handle it:

commodity $1,000.00
commodity EUR 1.000,00
commodity INR 9,99,99,999.00
commodity       1 000 000.9455


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Amount display format,  Prev: Digit group marks,  Up: Amounts

1.7.2 Amount display format
---------------------------

For each commodity, hledger chooses a consistent format to use when
displaying amounts.  (Except price amounts, which are always displayed
as written).  The display format is chosen as follows:

   * If there is a commodity directive for the commodity, that format is
     used (see examples above).

   * Otherwise the format of the first posting amount in that commodity
     seen in the journal is used.  But the number of decimal places
     ("precision") will be the maximum from all posting amounts in that
     commmodity.

   * Or if there are no such amounts in the journal, a default format is
     used (like '$1000.00').

   Price amounts, and amounts in 'D' directives don't affect the amount
display format directly, but occasionally they can do so indirectly.
(Eg when D's default commodity is applied to a commodity-less amount, or
when an amountless posting is balanced using a price's commodity, or
when -V is used.)  If you find this causing problems, use a commodity
directive to set the display format.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Virtual Postings,  Next: Balance Assertions,  Prev: Amounts,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.8 Virtual Postings
====================

When you parenthesise the account name in a posting, we call that a
_virtual posting_, which means:

   * it is ignored when checking that the transaction is balanced
   * it is excluded from reports when the '--real/-R' flag is used, or
     the 'real:1' query.

   You could use this, eg, to set an account's opening balance without
needing to use the 'equity:opening balances' account:

1/1 special unbalanced posting to set initial balance
  (assets:checking)   $1000

   When the account name is bracketed, we call it a _balanced virtual
posting_.  This is like an ordinary virtual posting except the balanced
virtual postings in a transaction must balance to 0, like the real
postings (but separately from them).  Balanced virtual postings are also
excluded by '--real/-R' or 'real:1'.

1/1 buy food with cash, and update some budget-tracking subaccounts elsewhere
  expenses:food                   $10
  assets:cash                    $-10
  [assets:checking:available]     $10
  [assets:checking:budget:food]  $-10

   Virtual postings have some legitimate uses, but those are few.  You
can usually find an equivalent journal entry using real postings, which
is more correct and provides better error checking.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Balance Assertions,  Next: Balance Assignments,  Prev: Virtual Postings,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.9 Balance Assertions
======================

hledger supports Ledger-style balance assertions in journal files.
These look like, for example, '= EXPECTEDBALANCE' following a posting's
amount.  Eg here we assert the expected dollar balance in accounts a and
b after each posting:

2013/1/1
  a   $1  =$1
  b       =$-1

2013/1/2
  a   $1  =$2
  b  $-1  =$-2

   After reading a journal file, hledger will check all balance
assertions and report an error if any of them fail.  Balance assertions
can protect you from, eg, inadvertently disrupting reconciled balances
while cleaning up old entries.  You can disable them temporarily with
the '-I/--ignore-assertions' flag, which can be useful for
troubleshooting or for reading Ledger files.

File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Assertions and ordering,  Next: Assertions and included files,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.9.1 Assertions and ordering
-----------------------------

hledger sorts an account's postings and assertions first by date and
then (for postings on the same day) by parse order.  Note this is
different from Ledger, which sorts assertions only by parse order.
(Also, Ledger assertions do not see the accumulated effect of repeated
postings to the same account within a transaction.)

   So, hledger balance assertions keep working if you reorder
differently-dated transactions within the journal.  But if you reorder
same-dated transactions or postings, assertions might break and require
updating.  This order dependence does bring an advantage: precise
control over the order of postings and assertions within a day, so you
can assert intra-day balances.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Assertions and included files,  Next: Assertions and multiple -f options,  Prev: Assertions and ordering,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.9.2 Assertions and included files
-----------------------------------

With included files, things are a little more complicated.  Including
preserves the ordering of postings and assertions.  If you have multiple
postings to an account on the same day, split across different files,
and you also want to assert the account's balance on the same day,
you'll have to put the assertion in the right file.

1.9.3 Assertions and multiple -f options
----------------------------------------

Balance assertions don't work well across files specified with multiple
-f options.  Use include or concatenate the files instead.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Assertions and commodities,  Next: Assertions and prices,  Prev: Assertions and multiple -f options,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.9.4 Assertions and commodities
--------------------------------

The asserted balance must be a simple single-commodity amount, and in
fact the assertion checks only this commodity's balance within the
(possibly multi-commodity) account balance.
This is how assertions work in Ledger also.  We could call this a
"partial" balance assertion.

   To assert the balance of more than one commodity in an account, you
can write multiple postings, each asserting one commodity's balance.

   You can make a stronger "total" balance assertion by writing a double
equals sign ('== EXPECTEDBALANCE').  This asserts that there are no
other unasserted commodities in the account (or, that their balance is
0).

2013/1/1
  a   $1
  a    1€
  b  $-1
  c   -1€

2013/1/2  ; These assertions succeed
  a    0  =  $1
  a    0  =   1€
  b    0 == $-1
  c    0 ==  -1€

2013/1/3  ; This assertion fails as 'a' also contains 1€
  a    0 ==  $1

   It's not yet possible to make a complete assertion about a balance
that has multiple commodities.  One workaround is to isolate each
commodity into its own subaccount:

2013/1/1
  a:usd   $1
  a:euro   1€
  b

2013/1/2
  a        0 ==  0
  a:usd    0 == $1
  a:euro   0 ==  1€

1.9.5 Assertions and prices
---------------------------

Balance assertions ignore transaction prices, and should normally be
written without one:

2019/1/1
  (a)     $1 @ €1 = $1

   We do allow prices to be written there, however, and print shows
them, even though they don't affect whether the assertion passes or
fails.  This is for backward compatibility (hledger's close command used
to generate balance assertions with prices), and because balance
_assignments_ do use them (see below).

1.9.6 Assertions and subaccounts
--------------------------------

The balance assertions above ('=' and '==') do not count the balance
from subaccounts; they check the account's exclusive balance only.  You
can assert the balance including subaccounts by writing '=*' or '==*',
eg:

2019/1/1
  equity:opening balances
  checking:a       5
  checking:b       5
  checking         1  ==* 11

virtual.  They are not affected by the '--real/-R' flag or 'real:'
query.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Assertions and precision,  Prev: Assertions and virtual postings,  Up: Balance Assertions

1.9.8 Assertions and precision
------------------------------

Balance assertions compare the exactly calculated amounts, which are not
always what is shown by reports.  Eg a commodity directive may limit the
display precision, but this will not affect balance assertions.  Balance
assertion failure messages show exact amounts.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Balance Assignments,  Next: Transaction prices,  Prev: Balance Assertions,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.10 Balance Assignments
========================

Ledger-style balance assignments are also supported.  These are like
balance assertions, but with no posting amount on the left side of the
equals sign; instead it is calculated automatically so as to satisfy the
assertion.  This can be a convenience during data entry, eg when setting
opening balances:

; starting a new journal, set asset account balances 
2016/1/1 opening balances
  assets:checking            = $409.32
  assets:savings             = $735.24
  assets:cash                 = $42
  equity:opening balances

   or when adjusting a balance to reality:

; no cash left; update balance, record any untracked spending as a generic expense
2016/1/15
  assets:cash    = $0
  expenses:misc

   The calculated amount depends on the account's balance in the
commodity at that point (which depends on the previously-dated postings
of the commodity to that account since the last balance assertion or
assignment).  Note that using balance assignments makes your journal a
little less explicit; to know the exact amount posted, you have to run
hledger or do the calculations yourself, instead of just reading it.

1.10.1 Balance assignments and prices
-------------------------------------

A transaction price in a balance assignment will cause the calculated
amount to have that price attached:

$ hledger print --explicit
2019/01/01
    (a)         $1 @ €2 = $1 @ €2

1.11 Transaction prices
=======================

Within a transaction, you can note an amount's price in another
commodity.  This can be used to document the cost (in a purchase) or
selling price (in a sale).  For example, transaction prices are useful
to record purchases of a foreign currency.  Note transaction prices are
fixed at the time of the transaction, and do not change over time.  See
also market prices, which represent prevailing exchange rates on a
certain date.

   There are several ways to record a transaction price:

  1. Write the price per unit, as '@ UNITPRICE' after the amount:

     2009/1/1
       assets:euros     €100 @ $1.35  ; one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
       assets:dollars                 ; balancing amount is -$135.00

  2. Write the total price, as '@@ TOTALPRICE' after the amount:

     2009/1/1
       assets:euros     €100 @@ $135  ; one hundred euros purchased at $135 for the lot
       assets:dollars

  3. Specify amounts for all postings, using exactly two commodities,
     and let hledger infer the price that balances the transaction:

     2009/1/1
       assets:euros     €100          ; one hundred euros purchased
       assets:dollars  $-135          ; for $135

   (Ledger users: Ledger uses a different syntax for fixed prices,
'{=UNITPRICE}', which hledger currently ignores).

   Use the '-B/--cost' flag to convert amounts to their transaction
price's commodity, if any.  (mnemonic: "B" is from "cost Basis", as in
Ledger).  Eg here is how -B affects the balance report for the example
above:

$ hledger bal -N --flat
               $-135  assets:dollars
                €100  assets:euros
$ hledger bal -N --flat -B
               $-135  assets:dollars
                $135  assets:euros    # <- the euros' cost

   Note -B is sensitive to the order of postings when a transaction
price is inferred: the inferred price will be in the commodity of the
last amount.  So if example 3's postings are reversed, while the
transaction is equivalent, -B shows something different:

2009/1/1
  assets:dollars  $-135              ; 135 dollars sold
  assets:euros     €100              ; for 100 euros

$ hledger bal -N --flat -B
               €-100  assets:dollars  # <- the dollars' selling price
                €100  assets:euros

1.12 Comments
=============

Lines in the journal beginning with a semicolon (';') or hash ('#') or
star ('*') are comments, and will be ignored.  (Star comments cause
org-mode nodes to be ignored, allowing emacs users to fold and navigate
their journals with org-mode or orgstruct-mode.)

   You can attach comments to a transaction by writing them after the
description and/or indented on the following lines (before the
postings).  Similarly, you can attach comments to an individual posting
by writing them after the amount and/or indented on the following lines.
Transaction and posting comments must begin with a semicolon (';').

   Some examples:

# a file comment

; also a file comment

comment
This is a multiline file comment,
which continues until a line
where the "end comment" string
appears on its own (or end of file).
end comment

2012/5/14 something  ; a transaction comment
    ; the transaction comment, continued
    posting1  1  ; a comment for posting 1
    posting2
    ; a comment for posting 2
    ; another comment line for posting 2
; a file comment (because not indented)

   You can also comment larger regions of a file using 'comment' and
'end comment' directives.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Tags,  Next: Directives,  Prev: Comments,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.13 Tags
=========

Tags are a way to add extra labels or labelled data to postings and
transactions, which you can then search or pivot on.

   A simple tag is a word (which may contain hyphens) followed by a full
colon, written inside a transaction or posting comment line:

2017/1/16 bought groceries  ; sometag:

   Tags can have a value, which is the text after the colon, up to the
next comma or end of line, with leading/trailing whitespace removed:

    expenses:food    $10 ; a-posting-tag: the tag value

   Note this means hledger's tag values can not contain commas or
newlines.  Ending at commas means you can write multiple short tags on
one line, comma separated:

    assets:checking  ; a comment containing tag1:, tag2: some value ...

   Here,

   * "'a comment containing'" is just comment text, not a tag
   * "'tag1'" is a tag with no value
   * "'tag2'" is another tag, whose value is "'some value ...'"

   Tags in a transaction comment affect the transaction and all of its
postings, while tags in a posting comment affect only that posting.  For
example, the following transaction has three tags ('A', 'TAG2',
'third-tag') and the posting has four (those plus 'posting-tag'):

1/1 a transaction  ; A:, TAG2:
    ; third-tag: a third transaction tag, <- with a value
    (a)  $1  ; posting-tag:

   Tags are like Ledger's metadata feature, except hledger's tag values
are simple strings.

1.14 Directives
===============

A directive is a line in the journal beginning with a special keyword,
that influences how the journal is processed.  hledger's directives are
based on a subset of Ledger's, but there are many differences (and also
some differences between hledger versions).

   Directives' behaviour and interactions can get a little bit complex,
so here is a table summarising the directives and their effects, with
links to more detailed docs.

number    how to interpret numbers when parsing journal entries (the

display   how to display amounts of a commodity in reports (symbol side
style     and spacing, digit groups, decimal separator, decimal places)
directive which entries and (when there are multiple files) which files

   As you can see, directives vary in which journal entries and files
they affect, and whether they are focussed on input (parsing) or output
(reports).  Some directives have multiple effects.

   If you have a journal made up of multiple files, or pass multiple -f
options on the command line, note that directives which affect input
typically last only until the end of their defining file.  This provides
more simplicity and predictability, eg reports are not changed by
writing file options in a different order.  It can be surprising at
times though.

File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Comment blocks,  Next: Including other files,  Up: Directives

1.14.1 Comment blocks
---------------------

A line containing just 'comment' starts a commented region of the file,
and a line containing just 'end comment' (or the end of the current
file) ends it.  See also comments.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Including other files,  Next: Default year,  Prev: Comment blocks,  Up: Directives

1.14.2 Including other files
----------------------------

You can pull in the content of additional files by writing an include
directive, like this:

include path/to/file.journal

   If the path does not begin with a slash, it is relative to the
current file.  The include file path may contain common glob patterns
(e.g.  '*').

   The 'include' directive can only be used in journal files.  It can
include journal, timeclock or timedot files, but not CSV files.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Default year,  Next: Declaring commodities,  Prev: Including other files,  Up: Directives

1.14.3 Default year
-------------------

You can set a default year to be used for subsequent dates which don't
specify a year.  This is a line beginning with 'Y' followed by the year.
Eg:

Y2009  ; set default year to 2009

12/15  ; equivalent to 2009/12/15
  expenses  1
  assets

Y2010  ; change default year to 2010

2009/1/30  ; specifies the year, not affected
  expenses  1
  assets

1/31   ; equivalent to 2010/1/31
  expenses  1
  assets


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Declaring commodities,  Next: Default commodity,  Prev: Default year,  Up: Directives

1.14.4 Declaring commodities
----------------------------

The 'commodity' directive declares commodities which may be used in the
journal, and their display format.

   It may be written on a single line, like this:

; commodity EXAMPLEAMOUNT

; display AAAA amounts with the symbol on the right, space-separated,
; using period as decimal point, with four decimal places, and
; separating thousands with comma.
commodity 1,000.0000 AAAA

   or on multiple lines, using the "format" subdirective.  In this case
the commodity symbol appears twice and should be the same in both
places:

; commodity SYMBOL
;   format EXAMPLEAMOUNT

; display indian rupees with currency name on the left,
; thousands, lakhs and crores comma-separated,
; period as decimal point, and two decimal places.
commodity INR
  format INR 9,99,99,999.00

   Declaring commodites may be useful as documentation, but currently we
do not enforce that only declared commodities may be used.  This
directive is mainly useful for customising the preferred display format
for a commodity.

   Normally the display format is inferred from journal entries, but
this can be unpredictable; declaring it with a commodity directive
overrides this and removes ambiguity.  Towards this end, amounts in
commodity directives must always be written with a decimal point (a
period or comma, followed by 0 or more decimal digits).

   Commodity directives do not affect how amounts are parsed; the parser
will read multiple formats.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Default commodity,  Next: Market prices,  Prev: Declaring commodities,  Up: Directives

1.14.5 Default commodity
------------------------

The 'D' directive sets a default commodity (and display format), to be
used for amounts without a commodity symbol (ie, plain numbers).  (Note
this differs from Ledger's default commodity directive.)  The commodity
and display format will be applied to all subsequent commodity-less
amounts, or until the next 'D' directive.

; commodity-less amounts should be treated as dollars
; (and displayed with symbol on the left, thousands separators and two decimal places)
D $1,000.00

1/1
  a     5  ; <- commodity-less amount, becomes $1
  b

   As with the 'commodity' directive, the amount must always be written
with a decimal point.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Market prices,  Next: Declaring accounts,  Prev: Default commodity,  Up: Directives

1.14.6 Market prices
--------------------

The 'P' directive declares a market price, which is an exchange rate
between two commodities on a certain date.  (In Ledger, they are called
"historical prices".)  These are often obtained from a stock exchange,
cryptocurrency exchange, or the foreign exchange market.

   Here is the format:

P DATE COMMODITYA COMMODITYBAMOUNT

   * DATE is a simple date
   * COMMODITYA is the symbol of the commodity being priced
   * COMMODITYBAMOUNT is an amount (symbol and quantity) in a second
     commodity, giving the price in commodity B of one unit of commodity
     A.

   These two market price directives say that one euro was worth 1.35 US
dollars during 2009, and $1.40 from 2010 onward:

P 2009/1/1 € $1.35
P 2010/1/1 € $1.40

   The '-V/--value' flag can be used to convert reported amounts to
another commodity using these prices.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Declaring accounts,  Next: Rewriting accounts,  Prev: Market prices,  Up: Directives

1.14.7 Declaring accounts
-------------------------

'account' directives can be used to pre-declare accounts.  Though not
required, they can provide several benefits:

   * They can document your intended chart of accounts, providing a
     reference.
   * They can store extra information about accounts (account numbers,
     notes, etc.)
   * They can help hledger know your accounts' types (asset, liability,
     equity, revenue, expense), useful for reports like balancesheet and
     incomestatement.
   * They control account display order in reports, allowing
     non-alphabetic sorting (eg Revenues to appear above Expenses).
   * They help with account name completion in the add command,
     hledger-iadd, hledger-web, ledger-mode etc.

   The simplest form is just the word 'account' followed by a
hledger-style account name, eg:

account assets:bank:checking

* Menu:

* Account comments::
* Account subdirectives::
* Account types::
* Account display order::


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Account comments,  Next: Account subdirectives,  Up: Declaring accounts

1.14.7.1 Account comments
.........................

Comments, beginning with a semicolon, optionally including tags, can be
written after the account name, and/or on following lines.  Eg:

account assets:bank:checking  ; a comment
  ; another comment
  ; acctno:12345, a tag

   Tip: comments on the same line require hledger 1.12+.  If you need
your journal to be compatible with older hledger versions, write
comments on the next line instead.

1.14.7.2 Account subdirectives
..............................

We also allow (and ignore) Ledger-style indented subdirectives, just for

  [;COMMENTS]
  [LEDGER-STYLE SUBDIRECTIVES, IGNORED]


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Account types,  Next: Account display order,  Prev: Account subdirectives,  Up: Declaring accounts

1.14.7.3 Account types
......................

hledger recognises five types (or classes) of account: Asset, Liability,
Equity, Revenue, Expense.  This is used by a few accounting-aware
reports such as balancesheet, incomestatement and cashflow.
Auto-detected account types If you name your top-level accounts with
some variation of 'assets', 'liabilities'/'debts', 'equity',
'revenues'/'income', or 'expenses', their types are detected
automatically.  Account types declared with tags More generally, you can
declare an account's type with an account directive, by writing a
'type:' tag in a comment, followed by one of the words 'Asset',
'Liability', 'Equity', 'Revenue', 'Expense', or one of the letters
'ALERX' (case insensitive):

account assets       ; type:Asset
account liabilities  ; type:Liability
account equity       ; type:Equity
account revenues     ; type:Revenue
account expenses     ; type:Expenses

   Account types declared with account type codes Or, you can write one
of those letters separated from the account name by two or more spaces,
but this should probably be considered deprecated as of hledger 1.13:

account assets       A
account liabilities  L
account equity       E
account revenues     R
account expenses     X

   Overriding auto-detected types If you ever override the types of
those auto-detected english account names mentioned above, you might
need to help the reports a bit.  Eg:

; make "liabilities" not have the liability type - who knows why
account liabilities  ; type:E

; we need to ensure some other account has the liability type, 
; otherwise balancesheet would still show "liabilities" under Liabilities 
account -            ; type:L


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Account display order,  Prev: Account types,  Up: Declaring accounts

1.14.7.4 Account display order
..............................

Account directives also set the order in which accounts are displayed,
eg in reports, the hledger-ui accounts screen, and the hledger-web
sidebar.  By default accounts are listed in alphabetical order.  But if
you have these account directives in the journal:

account assets
account liabilities
account equity
account revenues
account expenses

   you'll see those accounts displayed in declaration order, not
alphabetically:

$ hledger accounts -1
assets
liabilities
equity
revenues
expenses

   Undeclared accounts, if any, are displayed last, in alphabetical
order.

   Note that sorting is done at each level of the account tree (within
each group of sibling accounts under the same parent).  And currently,
this directive:

account other:zoo

   would influence the position of 'zoo' among 'other''s subaccounts,
but not the position of 'other' among the top-level accounts.  This
means: - you will sometimes declare parent accounts (eg 'account other'
above) that you don't intend to post to, just to customize their display
order - sibling accounts stay together (you couldn't display 'x:y' in
between 'a:b' and 'a:c').

1.14.8 Rewriting accounts
-------------------------

You can define account alias rules which rewrite your account names, or
parts of them, before generating reports.  This can be useful for:

   * expanding shorthand account names to their full form, allowing
     easier data entry and a less verbose journal
   * adapting old journals to your current chart of accounts
   * experimenting with new account organisations, like a new hierarchy
     or combining two accounts into one
   * customising reports

   Account aliases also rewrite account names in account directives.
They do not affect account names being entered via hledger add or
hledger-web.

   See also Cookbook: Rewrite account names.

* Regex aliases::

File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Basic aliases,  Next: Regex aliases,  Up: Rewriting accounts

1.14.8.1 Basic aliases
......................

To set an account alias, use the 'alias' directive in your journal file.
This affects all subsequent journal entries in the current file or its
included files.  The spaces around the = are optional:

alias OLD = NEW

   Or, you can use the '--alias 'OLD=NEW'' option on the command line.
This affects all entries.  It's useful for trying out aliases
interactively.

   OLD and NEW are case sensitive full account names.  hledger will
replace any occurrence of the old account name with the new one.
Subaccounts are also affected.  Eg:

alias checking = assets:bank:wells fargo:checking
; rewrites "checking" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking", or "checking:a" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking:a"


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Regex aliases,  Next: Combining aliases,  Prev: Basic aliases,  Up: Rewriting accounts

1.14.8.2 Regex aliases
......................

There is also a more powerful variant that uses a regular expression,
indicated by the forward slashes:

alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT

   or '--alias '/REGEX/=REPLACEMENT''.

   REGEX is a case-insensitive regular expression.  Anywhere it matches
inside an account name, the matched part will be replaced by
REPLACEMENT. If REGEX contains parenthesised match groups, these can be
referenced by the usual numeric backreferences in REPLACEMENT. Eg:

alias /^(.+):bank:([^:]+)(.*)/ = \1:\2 \3
; rewrites "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking" to  "assets:wells fargo checking"

   Also note that REPLACEMENT continues to the end of line (or on
command line, to end of option argument), so it can contain trailing
whitespace.

1.14.8.3 Combining aliases
..........................

You can define as many aliases as you like, using journal directives
and/or command line options.

   Recursive aliases - where an account name is rewritten by one alias,
then by another alias, and so on - are allowed.  Each alias sees the
effect of previously applied aliases.

   In such cases it can be important to understand which aliases will be
applied and in which order.  For (each account name in) each journal
entry, we apply:

  1. 'alias' directives preceding the journal entry, most recently
     parsed first (ie, reading upward from the journal entry, bottom to
     top)
  2. '--alias' options, in the order they appeared on the command line
     (left to right).

   In other words, for (an account name in) a given journal entry:

   * the nearest alias declaration before/above the entry is applied
     first
   * the next alias before/above that will be be applied next, and so on
   * aliases defined after/below the entry do not affect it.

   This gives nearby aliases precedence over distant ones, and helps
provide semantic stability - aliases will keep working the same way
independent of which files are being read and in which order.

   In case of trouble, adding '--debug=6' to the command line will show
which aliases are being applied when.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: end aliases,  Prev: Combining aliases,  Up: Rewriting accounts

1.14.8.4 'end aliases'
......................

You can clear (forget) all currently defined aliases with the 'end
aliases' directive:

end aliases


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Default parent account,  Prev: Rewriting accounts,  Up: Directives

1.14.9 Default parent account
-----------------------------

You can specify a parent account which will be prepended to all accounts
within a section of the journal.  Use the 'apply account' and 'end apply
account' directives like so:

apply account home

2010/1/1
    food    $10
    cash

end apply account

   which is equivalent to:

2010/01/01
    home:food           $10
    home:cash          $-10

   If 'end apply account' is omitted, the effect lasts to the end of the
file.  Included files are also affected, eg:

apply account business
include biz.journal
end apply account
apply account personal
include personal.journal

   Prior to hledger 1.0, legacy 'account' and 'end' spellings were also
supported.

   A default parent account also affects account directives.  It does
not affect account names being entered via hledger add or hledger-web.
If account aliases are present, they are applied after the default
parent account.

1.15 Periodic transactions
==========================

Periodic transaction rules describe transactions that recur.  They allow
hledger to generate temporary future transactions to help with
forecasting, so you don't have to write out each one in the journal, and
it's easy to try out different forecasts.  Secondly, they are also used
to define the budgets shown in budget reports.

   Periodic transactions can be a little tricky, so before you use them,
read this whole section - or at least these tips:

  1. Two spaces accidentally added or omitted will cause you trouble -
     read about this below.
  2. For troubleshooting, show the generated transactions with 'hledger
     print --forecast tag:generated' or 'hledger register --forecast
     tag:generated'.
  3. Forecasted transactions will begin only after the last
     non-forecasted transaction's date.
  4. Forecasted transactions will end 6 months from today, by default.
     See below for the exact start/end rules.
  5. period expressions can be tricky.  Their documentation needs
     improvement, but is worth studying.
  6. Some period expressions with a repeating interval must begin on a
     natural boundary of that interval.  Eg in 'weekly from DATE', DATE
     must be a monday.  '~ weekly from 2019/10/1' (a tuesday) will give
     an error.
  7. Other period expressions with an interval are automatically
     expanded to cover a whole number of that interval.  (This is done
     to improve reports, but it also affects periodic transactions.
     Yes, it's a bit inconsistent with the above.)  Eg: '~ every 10th
     day of month from 2020/01', which is equivalent to '~ every 10th
     day of month from 2020/01/01', will be adjusted to start on
     2019/12/10.

File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Periodic rule syntax,  Next: Two spaces between period expression and description!,  Up: Periodic transactions

1.15.1 Periodic rule syntax
---------------------------

A periodic transaction rule looks like a normal journal entry, with the
date replaced by a tilde ('~') followed by a period expression
(mnemonic: '~' looks like a recurring sine wave.):

~ monthly
    expenses:rent          $2000
    assets:bank:checking

   There is an additional constraint on the period expression: the start
date must fall on a natural boundary of the interval.  Eg 'monthly from
2018/1/1' is valid, but 'monthly from 2018/1/15' is not.

   Partial or relative dates (M/D, D, tomorrow, last week) in the period
expression can work (useful or not).  They will be relative to today's
date, unless a Y default year directive is in effect, in which case they
will be relative to Y/1/1.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Two spaces between period expression and description!,  Next: Forecasting with periodic transactions,  Prev: Periodic rule syntax,  Up: Periodic transactions

1.15.2 Two spaces between period expression and description!
------------------------------------------------------------

If the period expression is followed by a transaction description, these
must be separated by *two or more spaces*.  This helps hledger know
where the period expression ends, so that descriptions can not
accidentally alter their meaning, as in this example:

; 2 or more spaces needed here, so the period is not understood as "every 2 months in 2020"
;               ||
;               vv
~ every 2 months  in 2020, we will review
    assets:bank:checking   $1500
    income:acme inc

   So,

   * Do write two spaces between your period expression and your
     transaction description, if any.
   * Don't accidentally write two spaces in the middle of your period
     expression.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Forecasting with periodic transactions,  Next: Budgeting with periodic transactions,  Prev: Two spaces between period expression and description!,  Up: Periodic transactions

1.15.3 Forecasting with periodic transactions
---------------------------------------------

With the '--forecast' flag, each periodic transaction rule generates
future transactions recurring at the specified interval.  These are not
saved in the journal, but appear in all reports.  They will look like
normal transactions, but with an extra tag:

   * 'generated-transaction:~ PERIODICEXPR' - shows that this was
     generated by a periodic transaction rule, and the period

   There is also a hidden tag, with an underscore prefix, which does not
appear in hledger's output:

   * '_generated-transaction:~ PERIODICEXPR'

   This can be used to match transactions generated "just now", rather
than generated in the past and saved to the journal.

   Forecast transactions start on the first occurrence, and end on the
last occurrence, of their interval within the forecast period.  The
forecast period:

   * begins on the later of
        * the report start date if specified with -b/-p/date:
        * the day after the latest normal (non-periodic) transaction in
          the journal, or today if there are no normal transactions.

   * ends on the report end date if specified with -e/-p/date:, or 180
     days from today.

   where "today" means the current date at report time.  The "later of"
rule ensures that forecast transactions do not overlap normal
transactions in time; they will begin only after normal transactions
end.

   Forecasting can be useful for estimating balances into the future,
and experimenting with different scenarios.  Note the start date logic
means that forecasted transactions are automatically replaced by normal
transactions as you add those.

   Forecasting can also help with data entry: describe most of your
transactions with periodic rules, and every so often copy the output of
'print --forecast' to the journal.

   You can generate one-time transactions too: just write a period
expression specifying a date with no report interval.  (You could also
write a normal transaction with a future date, but remember this
disables forecast transactions on previous dates.)


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Budgeting with periodic transactions,  Prev: Forecasting with periodic transactions,  Up: Periodic transactions

1.15.4 Budgeting with periodic transactions
-------------------------------------------

With the '--budget' flag, currently supported by the balance command,
each periodic transaction rule declares recurring budget goals for the
specified accounts.  Eg the first example above declares a goal of
spending $2000 on rent (and also, a goal of depositing $2000 into
checking) every month.  Goals and actual performance can then be
compared in budget reports.

   For more details, see: balance: Budget report and Budgeting and
Forecasting.


File: hledger_journal.info,  Node: Auto postings / transaction modifiers,  Prev: Periodic transactions,  Up: FILE FORMAT

1.16 Auto postings / transaction modifiers
==========================================

Transaction modifier rules, AKA auto posting rules, describe changes to
be applied automatically to certain matched transactions.  Currently
just one kind of change is possible - adding extra postings, which we
call "automated postings" or just "auto postings".  These rules become
active when you use the '--auto' flag.

   A transaction modifier rule looks much like a normal transaction
except the first line is an equals sign followed by a query that matches
certain postings (mnemonic: '=' suggests matching).  And each "posting"
is actually a posting-generating rule:

= QUERY
    ACCT  AMT
    ACCT  [AMT]
    ...

   These posting-generating rules look like normal postings, except the
amount can be:

   * a normal amount with a commodity symbol, eg '$2'.  This will be
     used as-is.
   * a number, eg '2'.  The commodity symbol (if any) from the matched
     posting will be added to this.
   * a numeric multiplier, eg '*2' (a star followed by a number N). The
     matched posting's amount (and total price, if any) will be
     multiplied by N.
   * a multiplier with a commodity symbol, eg '*$2' (a star, number N,
     and symbol S). The matched posting's amount will be multiplied by
     N, and its commodity symbol will be replaced with S.

   These rules have global effect - a rule appearing anywhere in your
data can potentially affect any transaction, including transactions
recorded above it or in another file.

   Some examples:

; every time I buy food, schedule a dollar donation
= expenses:food
    (liabilities:charity)   $-1

; when I buy a gift, also deduct that amount from a budget envelope subaccount
= expenses:gifts
    assets:checking:gifts  *-1
    assets:checking         *1

2017/12/1
  expenses:food    $10
  assets:checking

2017/12/14
  expenses:gifts   $20
  assets:checking

$ hledger print --auto
2017/12/01
    expenses:food              $10
    assets:checking
    (liabilities:charity)      $-1

2017/12/14
    expenses:gifts             $20
    assets:checking
    assets:checking:gifts     -$20
    assets:checking            $20

precedence) a posting date in the auto posting rule itself, will also be
used in the generated posting.

1.16.2 Auto postings and transaction balancing / inferred amounts /
-------------------------------------------------------------------

balance assertions Currently, transaction modifiers are applied / auto
postings are added:

   * after missing amounts are inferred, and transactions are checked
     for balancedness,
   * but before balance assertions are checked.

   Note this means that journal entries must be balanced both before and
after auto postings are added.  This changed in hledger 1.12+; see #893
for background.

1.16.3 Auto posting tags
------------------------

Postings added by transaction modifiers will have some extra tags:

   * 'generated-posting:= QUERY' - shows this was generated by an auto
     posting rule, and the query
   * '_generated-posting:= QUERY' - a hidden tag, which does not appear
     in hledger's output.  This can be used to match postings generated
     "just now", rather than generated in the past and saved to the
     journal.

   Also, any transaction that has been changed by transaction modifier
rules will have these tags added:

   * 'modified:' - this transaction was modified
   * '_modified:' - a hidden tag not appearing in the comment; this
     transaction was modified "just now".

2 EDITOR SUPPORT
****************

Helper modes exist for popular text editors, which make working with
journal files easier.  They add colour, formatting, tab completion, and
helpful commands, and are quite recommended if you edit your journal
with a text editor.  They include ledger-mode or hledger-mode for Emacs,
vim-ledger for Vim, hledger-vscode for Visual Studio Code, and others.
See the [[Cookbook]] at hledger.org for the latest information.
