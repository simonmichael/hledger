## 2011/11/1 HCAR

hledger is a library and end-user tool (with command-line, curses and web
interfaces) for converting, recording, and analyzing financial
transactions, using a simple human-editable plain text file format. It is
a haskell port and friendly fork of John Wiegley's Ledger, licensed under
GNU GPLv3+.

hledger aims to be a reliable, practical tool for daily use. It reports
charts of accounts or account balances, filters transactions by type,
helps you record new transactions, converts CSV data from your bank,
publishes your text journal with a rich web interface, generates simple
charts, and provides an API for use in your own financial scripts and
apps.

In the last six months there have been two major releases. 0.15 focussed
on features and 0.16 focussed on quality. Changes include:

- new modal command-line interface, extensible with hledger-* executables in the path
- more useful web interface, with real account registers and basic charts
- hledger-web no longer needs to create support files, and uses latest yesod & warp
- more ledger compatibility
- misc command enhancements, API improvements, bug fixes, documentation updates
- lines of code increased by 3k to 8k
- project committers increased by 6 to 21

Current plans include:

- Continue the release rhythm of odd-numbered = features, even-numbered =
  quality/stability/polish, and releasing on the first of a month

- In 0.17, clean up the storage layer, allow rcs integration via
  filestore, and read (or convert) more formats

- Keep working towards wider usefulness, improving the web interface and
  providing standard financial reports

## 2011/05 HCAR

hledger is a haskell port and friendly fork of John Wiegley's ledger.  It
is a robust command-line accounting tool with a simple human-editable data
format. Given a plain text file describing transactions, of money or any
other commodity, hledger will print the chart of accounts, account
balances, or transactions you're interested in.  It can also help you
record transactions, or convert CSV data from your bank. There are also
curses and web interfaces. The project aims to provide a reliable,
practical day-to-day financial reporting tool, and also a useful library
for building financial apps in haskell.

Since hledger's last HCAR entry in 2009, hledger became cabalised, had 10
non-bugfix releases on hackage, split into multiple packages, acquired a
public mailing list, bug tracker, fairly comprehensive manual,
cross-platform binaries, and has grown to 5k lines of code and 15
committers. 0.14 has just been released, with 5 code committers.

The project is available under the GNU GPLv3 or later, at http://hledger.org .

Current plans are to continue development at a steady pace, to attract
more developers, and to become more useful to a wider range of users, eg
by building in more awareness of standard accounting procedures and by
improving the web and other interfaces.

    commodity/decimal places/price, like ledger
  * register: fix bad layout with years < 1000
  * register: fix a Prelude.head error with reporting interval,
    --empty, and --depth

    Cheplyaka)

    Cheplyaka)
  * add: a command-line argument now filters by account during
    history matching (Roman Cheplyaka)

## 2009/12/11 hledger 0.7

[announcement](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.finance.ledger.hledger/193)

  * price history support (first cut): P directives now work,
    though differently from c++ ledger. Each posting amount takes its
    fixed unit price from the price history (or
    @) when available. This is simple and useful for things like
    foreign currency expenses (but not investment tracking). Like
    ledger, balance and register don't show amount prices any more, and
    don't separate differently-priced amounts. Unlike ledger, print
    shows all amount prices, and supports -B.
  * --effective option, will use transactions' effective dates if
    any
  * convert: new rules file format, find/create rules file
    automatically, more robust parsing, more useful --debug output
  * print: always sort by date, fix long account name truncation,
    align amounts, show end of line comments, show all amounts for
    clarity (don't elide the final balancing amount)
  * ui: use vty 4, fixes non-ascii and gnome terminal problems
    (issues \#3, \#4)
  * web: allow data entry, react to data file changes, better
    layout, help links, remove histogram command and filter fields for
    now, fix bad localhost redirect, filter form did not work in eg
    firefox (issue \#7), reset link did not work in all browsers

## 2009/05 HCAR

hledger is a (primarily) command-line accounting tool similar to John
Wiegley's "ledger".  It reads a plain text journal file describing money
or commodity transactions, or timelog entries, and generates precise
activity and balance reports.

Since the last report, hledger has reached release 0.4 on Hackage. It has
60 test cases, new features such as basic curses and web-based interfaces,
and has had some performance tuning. It is now quite useful for day to day
reporting of money and time. Also, the project has a new web address
(hledger.org), and has attracted two new committers.

## 2009/04/03 hledger 0.4

    -f happs to build this)

  * patterns are now case-insensitive, like ledger
  * !include directives are now relative to the including file (Tim
    Docker)
  * "Y2009" default year directives are now supported, allowing m/d
    dates in ledger
  * individual transactions now have a cleared status
  * unbalanced entries now cause a proper warning
  * balance report now passes all ledger compatibility tests
  * balance report now shows subtotals by default, like ledger 3
  * balance report shows the final zero total when -E is used
  * balance report hides the final total when ..no-total is used
  * ..depth affects print and register reports (aggregating with a
    reporting interval, filtering otherwise)
  * register report sorts transactions by date
  * register report shows zero-amount transactions when -E is used
  * provide more convenient timelog querying when invoked as
    "hours"
  * multi-day timelog sessions are split at midnight
  * unterminated timelog sessions are now counted. Accurate time
    reports at last!
  * the test command gives better ..verbose output
  * ..version gives more detailed version numbers including
    patchlevel for dev builds
  * new make targets include: ghci, haddocktest, doctest, unittest,
    view-api-docs

    added

    now

    today, last week etc.)
  * ..period/-p flag accepting period expressions like "in 2008",
    "weekly from last month"..
  * -W/-M/-Y convenience flags to summarise register weekly,
    monthly, yearly
  * ..depth and -E flags also affect summarised register reports
    (including depth=0)
  * ..display/-d flag supporting date predicates (like "d<[DATE]",
    "d\>=[DATE]")
  * !include directive to include additional ledger files
  * !account directive to set a default parent account
  * Added support for reading historical prices from files
  * timelog and ledger entries can be intermixed in one file

## 2008/11 HCAR

hledger is a command-line accounting tool similar to John Wiegley’s ledger tool.

The first release has been published on Hackage, and has attracted some
interest. It can be used for generating simple balance and transaction
reports from a plain-text general ledger. A home page and mail list has
also been created.

Immediate plans are to add some more of the most useful features from c++
ledger, so that hledger can be used for day-to-day finances, and to grow
the community of contributors.
