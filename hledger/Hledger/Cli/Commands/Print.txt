print, txns, p
Show transaction journal entries, sorted by date.

_FLAGS_

The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from the
journal file in date order, tidily formatted. With --date2, transactions
are sorted by secondary date instead.

print's output is always a valid hledger journal.
It preserves all transaction information, but it does not preserve
directives or inter-transaction comments

$ hledger print
2008/01/01 income
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:salary                  $-1

2008/06/01 gift
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:gifts                   $-1

2008/06/02 save
    assets:bank:saving              $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1

2008/06/03 * eat & shop
    expenses:food                $1
    expenses:supplies            $1
    assets:cash                 $-2

2008/12/31 * pay off
    liabilities:debts               $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1

Normally, the journal entry's explicit or implicit amount style is
preserved. Ie when an amount is omitted in the journal, it will be
omitted in the output. You can use the -x/--explicit flag to make all
amounts explicit, which can be useful for troubleshooting or for making
your journal more readable and robust against data entry errors. Note,
-x will cause postings with a multi-commodity amount (these can arise
when a multi-commodity transaction has an implicit amount) will be split
into multiple single-commodity postings, for valid journal output.

With -B/--cost, amounts with transaction prices are converted to cost
using that price. This can be used for troubleshooting.

With -m/--match and a STR argument, print will show at most one
transaction: the one one whose description is most similar to STR, and
is most recent. STR should contain at least two characters. If there is
no similar-enough match, no transaction will be shown.

With --new, for each FILE being read, hledger reads (and writes) a
special state file (.latest.FILE in the same directory), containing the
latest transaction date(s) that were seen last time FILE was read. When
this file is found, only transactions with newer dates (and new
transactions on the latest date) are printed. This is useful for
ignoring already-seen entries in import data, such as downloaded CSV
files. Eg:

$ hledger -f bank1.csv print --new
# shows transactions added since last print --new on this file

This assumes that transactions added to FILE always have same or
increasing dates, and that transactions on the same day do not get
reordered. See also the import command.

This command also supports output destination and output format
selection. Here's an example of print's CSV output:

$ hledger print -Ocsv
"txnidx","date","date2","status","code","description","comment","account","amount","commodity","credit","debit","posting-status","posting-comment"
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","income:salary","-1","$","1","","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","income:gifts","-1","$","1","","",""
"3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:saving","1","$","","1","",""
"3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:food","1","$","","1","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:supplies","1","$","","1","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","assets:cash","-2","$","2","","",""
"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","liabilities:debts","1","$","","1","",""
"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""

-   There is one CSV record per posting, with the parent transaction's
    fields repeated.
-   The "txnidx" (transaction index) field shows which postings belong
    to the same transaction. (This number might change if transactions
    are reordered within the file, files are parsed/included in a
    different order, etc.)
-   The amount is separated into "commodity" (the symbol) and "amount"
    (numeric quantity) fields.
-   The numeric amount is repeated in either the "credit" or "debit"
    column, for convenience. (Those names are not accurate in the
    accounting sense; it just puts negative amounts under credit and
    zero or greater amounts under debit.)
