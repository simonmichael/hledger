.SH NAME
.PP
Timedot - hledger\[aq]s human-friendly time logging format
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Timedot is a plain text format for logging dated, categorised quantities
(of time, usually), supported by hledger.
It is convenient for approximate and retroactive time logging, eg when
the real-time clock-in/out required with a timeclock file is too precise
or too interruptive.
It can be formatted like a bar chart, making clear at a glance where
time was spent.
.PP
Though called \[dq]timedot\[dq], this format is read by hledger as
commodityless quantities, so it could be used to represent dated
quantities other than time.
In the docs below we\[aq]ll assume it\[aq]s time.
.PP
A timedot file contains a series of day entries.
A day entry begins with a non-indented hledger-style simple date (Y-M-D,
Y/M/D, Y.M.D..) Any additional text on the same line is used as a
transaction description for this day.
.PP
This is followed by optionally-indented timelog items for that day, one
per line.
Each timelog item is a note, usually a hledger:style:account:name
representing a time category, followed by two or more spaces, and a
quantity.
Each timelog item generates a hledger transaction.
.PP
Quantities can be written as:
.IP \[bu] 2
dots: a sequence of dots (.) representing quarter hours.
Spaces may optionally be used for grouping.
Eg: ....
\&..
.IP \[bu] 2
an integral or decimal number, representing hours.
Eg: 1.5
.IP \[bu] 2
an integral or decimal number immediately followed by a unit symbol
\f[C]s\f[R], \f[C]m\f[R], \f[C]h\f[R], \f[C]d\f[R], \f[C]w\f[R],
\f[C]mo\f[R], or \f[C]y\f[R], representing seconds, minutes, hours, days
weeks, months or years respectively.
Eg: 90m.
The following equivalencies are assumed, currently: 1m = 60s, 1h = 60m,
1d = 24h, 1w = 7d, 1mo = 30d, 1y=365d.
.PP
There is some flexibility allowing notes and todo lists to be kept right
in the time log, if needed:
.IP \[bu] 2
Blank lines and lines beginning with \f[C]#\f[R] or \f[C];\f[R] are
ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
Lines not ending with a double-space and quantity are parsed as items
taking no time, which will not appear in balance reports by default.
(Add -E to see them.)
.IP \[bu] 2
Org mode headlines (lines beginning with one or more \f[C]*\f[R]
followed by a space) can be used as date lines or timelog items (the
stars are ignored).
Also all org headlines before the first date line are ignored.
This means org users can manage their timelog as an org outline (eg
using org-mode/orgstruct-mode in Emacs), for organisation, faster
navigation, controlling visibility etc.

I prefer to use period for separating account components.
We can make this work with an account alias:
