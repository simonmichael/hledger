# ERRORS

<div class=pagetoc>

<!-- toc -->
</div>

hledger produces a variety of error messages in different situations.
They are intended first for humans and secondly for parsing by tools
like [flycheck-hledger][].
Here we collect examples of these errors, which are listed below
for reference, and also tested as part of our test suite.
This document is the README in the [hledger/test/errors/][] directory,
and also published as Developer docs > [ERRORS][] on hledger.org.

Each error has 

- a name (similar to [hledger check][] names when applicable)
- an executable script in this directory which reproduces the error (like `balanced.j`)
- which usually can also be used as a data file for manual testing (`hledger -f balanced.j check`)
- sometimes supplementary data files (like `csvdateparse.csv.rules`)
- an autogenerated shelltestrunner test (like `balanced.test`)

To update this readme with the latest error messages, run `make readme`.
To regenerate the shelltestrunner tests, run `make tests`.
To test all of these error messages with hledger, run `make test`.
To test these errors with flycheck-hledger,
customize `flycheck-hledger-*` in Emacs to enable all appropriate checks,
then open the data files to see how flycheck handles them.
`C-c ! l` opens a pane for easy viewing.

## Error improvement

Work is ongoing to make our error messages more consistent and more useful
([#1436](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1436),
[#1885](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/pull/1885), 
[#1886](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/pull/1886)..).
This is a big project, and your help is welcome; every bit of progress
counts, and this is a fast way to help users.

- [x] ~~phase 1: update flycheck to detect journal errors of current hledger release (and keep a branch updated to detect errors of latest hledger master)~~
- [x] ~~phase 2: survey/document current journal errors & status~~
- [x] ~~phase 3: pick a new standard format~~
- [x] ~~phase 4: implement standard format for all~~
- [x] ~~phase 5: implement accurate lines for all~~
- [x] ~~phase 6: implement accurate columns for all  [where possible; we currently do not save the position of every part of the transaction, so most errors do not report columns]~~
- [x] ~~phase 7: implement useful highlighted excerpts for all  [we show imperfect but useful highlighted regions]~~
- [x] ~~phase 8: implement accurate flycheck region for all  [flycheck-detected regions are imperfect but useful]~~
- [x] ~~phase 9: do likewise for timeclock errors~~
- [x] ~~phase 10: do likewise for timedot errors~~
- [ ] phase 11: do likewise for csv errors
- [ ] phase 12: do likewise for other command line errors
- [x] ~~phase 13: decide/add error ids/explanations/web pages ? not needed~~
- [ ] phase 14: support Language Server Protocol & Visual Code

## Standard error format

Here is our current preferred layout for error messages. 
It is similar to the parse error messages we get from megaparsec
(since it's easier to follow that than change it):
```
hledger: Error: FILE:LOCATION:
EXCERPT
EXPLANATION
```

Notes:

- line 1 includes "hledger" (dropping this would require some effort), the word "Error", and the error position
- FILE is the file path
- LOCATION is `LINE[-ENDLINE][:COLUMN[-ENDCOLUMN]]`
- EXCERPT is a short visual snippet whenever possible, with the error region highlighted, line numbers, and colour when supported. 
  This section must be easy for flycheck to ignore. (All lines begin with a space or a digit.)
- EXPLANATION briefly explains the problem, and suggests remedies if possible.
  It can be dynamic, showing context-sensitive info. (ShellCheck's summaries are static.)
- this layout is based on megaparsec's. For comparison, rustc puts summary on line 1 and location on line 2:
  ```
  Error[ID]: SUMMARY
  at FILE:LOCATION
  EXCERPT
  [DETAILS]
  ```
- try 
  <https://github.com/mesabloo/diagnose>,
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/errata>,
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/chapelure> later ?

## Limitations

Here are some current limitations of hledger's error messages:

- We report only one error at a time. You have to fix (or bypass) the current error to see any others.

- We currently don't save perfect position information when parsing,
  so we sometimes report only line number(s), without column number(s).

- For the same reason, the excerpts we show in error messages are not the original data.
  Instead we show a synthetic rendering that is similar enough to be explanatory.


## Error messages

Here is the current status as of
hledger (see version below) and flycheck-hledger g1310cb518.
Click error names to see an example. The table headings mean:

- std format - the error message follows our standard error format
- line       - correct line numbers are reported
- column     - useful column numbers are reported
- excerpt    - a useful excerpt is shown, ideally with the error highlighted (✓✓)
- flycheck   - the current flycheck release (or a PR branch) recognises the error and highlights a useful region
