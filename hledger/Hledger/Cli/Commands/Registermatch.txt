register-match
Print the one posting whose transaction description is closest to DESC,
in the style of the register command. If there are multiple equally good
matches, it shows the most recent. Query options (options, not
arguments) can be used to restrict the search space. Helps
ledger-autosync detect already-seen transactions when importing.
