hledger(1) hledger 1.3.99
*************************

This is hledger's command-line interface (there are also curses and web
interfaces).  Its basic function is to read a plain text file describing
financial transactions (in accounting terms, a general journal) and
print useful reports on standard output, or export them as CSV. hledger
can also read some other file formats such as CSV files, translating
them to journal format.  Additionally, hledger lists other hledger-*
executables found in the user's $PATH and can invoke them as
subcommands.

   hledger reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or
'$LEDGER_FILE', or '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  If using '$LEDGER_FILE', note this
must be a real environment variable, not a shell variable.  You can
specify standard input with '-f-'.

   Transactions are dated movements of money between two (or more) named
accounts, and are recorded with journal entries like this:

2015/10/16 bought food
 expenses:food          $10
 assets:cash

   For more about this format, see hledger_journal(5).

   Most users use a text editor to edit the journal, usually with an
editor mode such as ledger-mode for added convenience.  hledger's
interactive add command is another way to record new transactions.
hledger never changes existing transactions.

   To get started, you can either save some entries like the above in
'~/.hledger.journal', or run 'hledger add' and follow the prompts.  Then
try some commands like 'hledger print' or 'hledger balance'.  Run
'hledger' with no arguments for a list of commands.

2.1 General options
===================

To see general usage help, including general options which are supported
by most hledger commands, run 'hledger -h'.  (Note -h and -help are
different, like git.)

   General help options:

'-h --help'

     show general usage (or after COMMAND, command usage)
'--version'

     show version
'--debug[=N]'

     show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)

   General input options:

'-f FILE --file=FILE'

     use a different input file.  For stdin, use - (default:
     '$LEDGER_FILE' or '$HOME/.hledger.journal')
'--rules-file=RULESFILE'

     Conversion rules file to use when reading CSV (default: FILE.rules)
'--alias=OLD=NEW'

     rename accounts named OLD to NEW
'--anon'

     anonymize accounts and payees
'--pivot TAGNAME'

     use some other field/tag for account names
'-I --ignore-assertions'

     ignore any failing balance assertions

   General reporting options:

'-b --begin=DATE'

     include postings/txns on or after this date
'-e --end=DATE'

     include postings/txns before this date
'-D --daily'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by day
'-W --weekly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by week
'-M --monthly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by month
'-Q --quarterly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by quarter
'-Y --yearly'

     multiperiod/multicolumn report by year
'-p --period=PERIODEXP'

     set start date, end date, and/or reporting interval all at once
     (overrides the flags above)
'--date2'

     match the secondary date instead (see command help for other
     effects)
'-U --unmarked'

     include only unmarked postings/txns (can combine with -P or -C)
'-P --pending'

     include only pending postings/txns
'-C --cleared'

     include only cleared postings/txns
'-R --real'

     include only non-virtual postings
'--depth=N'

     hide accounts/postings deeper than N
'-E --empty'

     show items with zero amount, normally hidden
'-B --cost'

     convert amounts to their cost at transaction time (using the
     transaction price, if any)
'-V --value'

     convert amounts to their market value on the report end date (using
     the most recent applicable market price, if any)

   Note when multiple similar reporting options are provided, the last
one takes precedence.  Eg '-p feb -p mar' is equivalent to '-p mar'.

   Some of these can also be written as queries.

2.2 Command options
===================

To see options for a particular command, including command-specific
options, run: 'hledger COMMAND -h'.

   Command-specific options must be written after the command name, eg:
'hledger print -x'.

   Additionally, if the command is an addon, you may need to put its
options after a double-hyphen, eg: 'hledger ui -- --watch'.  Or, you can
run the addon executable directly: 'hledger-ui --watch'.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Command arguments,  Next: Special characters,  Prev: Command options,  Up: OPTIONS

2.3 Command arguments
=====================

Most hledger commands accept arguments after the command name, which are
often a query, filtering the data in some way.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Special characters,  Next: Input files,  Prev: Command arguments,  Up: OPTIONS

2.4 Special characters
======================

Option and argument values which contain problematic characters should
be escaped with double quotes, backslashes, or (best) single quotes.
Problematic characters means spaces, and also characters which are
significant to your command shell, such as less-than/greater-than.  Eg:
'hledger register -p 'last year' "accounts receivable
(receivable|payable)" amt:\>100'.

   Characters which are significant both to the shell and in regular
expressions sometimes need to be double-escaped.  These include
parentheses, the pipe symbol and the dollar sign.  Eg, to match the
dollar symbol, bash users should do: 'hledger balance cur:'\$'' or
'hledger balance cur:\\$'.

   There's more..  options and arguments get de-escaped when hledger is
passing them to an addon executable.  In this case you might need
_triple_-escaping.  Eg: 'hledger ui cur:'\\$'' or 'hledger ui
cur:\\\\$'.

   If in doubt, keep things simple:

   * run add-on executables directly
   * write options after the command
   * enclose problematic args in single quotes
   * if needed, also add a backslash to escape regexp metacharacters

   If you're really stumped, add '--debug=2' to troubleshoot.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Input files,  Next: Smart dates,  Prev: Special characters,  Up: OPTIONS

2.5 Input files
===============

hledger reads transactions from a data file (and the add command writes
to it).  By default this file is '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (or on
Windows, something like 'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  You can
override this with the '$LEDGER_FILE' environment variable:

$ setenv LEDGER_FILE ~/finance/2016.journal
$ hledger stats

   or with the '-f/--file' option:

$ hledger -f /some/file stats

   The file name '-' (hyphen) means standard input:

$ cat some.journal | hledger -f-

   Usually the data file is in hledger's journal format, but it can also
be one of several other formats, listed below.  hledger detects the
format automatically based on the file extension, or if that is not
recognised, by trying each built-in "reader" in turn:

Reader:     Reads:                             Used for file extensions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
'journal'   hledger's journal format, also     '.journal' '.j'
            some Ledger journals               '.hledger' '.ledger'
'timeclock' timeclock files (precise time      '.timeclock'
            logging)
'timedot'   timedot files (approximate time    '.timedot'
            logging)
'csv'       comma-separated values (data       '.csv'
            interchange)

   If needed (eg to ensure correct error messages when a file has the
"wrong" extension), you can force a specific reader/format by prepending
it to the file path with a colon.  Examples:

$ hledger -f csv:/some/csv-file.dat stats
$ echo 'i 2009/13/1 08:00:00' | hledger print -ftimeclock:-

   You can also specify multiple '-f' options, to read multiple files as
one big journal.  There are some limitations with this:

   * directives in one file will not affect the other files
   * balance assertions will not see any account balances from previous
     files

   If you need those, either use the include directive, or concatenate
the files, eg: 'cat a.journal b.journal | hledger -f- CMD'.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Smart dates,  Next: Report start & end date,  Prev: Input files,  Up: OPTIONS

2.6 Smart dates
===============

hledger's user interfaces accept a flexible "smart date" syntax (unlike
dates in the journal file).  Smart dates allow some english words, can
be relative to today's date, and can have less-significant date parts
omitted (defaulting to 1).

   Examples:

'2009/1/1', '2009/01/01', '2009-1-1', '2009.1.1'   simple dates, several separators allowed
'2009/1', '2009'                                   same as above - a missing day or month defaults to 1
'1/1', 'january', 'jan', 'this year'               relative dates, meaning january 1 of the current year
'next year'                                        january 1 of next year
'this month'                                       the 1st of the current month
'this week'                                        the most recent monday
'last week'                                        the monday of the week before this one
'lastweek'                                         spaces are optional
'today', 'yesterday', 'tomorrow'


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Report start & end date,  Next: Report intervals,  Prev: Smart dates,  Up: OPTIONS

2.7 Report start & end date
===========================

Most hledger reports show the full span of time represented by the
journal data, by default.  So, the effective report start and end dates
will be the earliest and latest transaction or posting dates found in
the journal.

   Often you will want to see a shorter time span, such as the current
month.  You can specify a start and/or end date using '-b/--begin',
'-e/--end', '-p/--period' or a 'date:' query (described below).  All of
these accept the smart date syntax.  One important thing to be aware of
when specifying end dates: as in Ledger, end dates are exclusive, so you
need to write the date _after_ the last day you want to include.

   Examples:

'-b 2016/3/17'      begin on St.  Patrick's day 2016
'-e 12/1'           end at the start of december 1st of the current year (11/30 will be the last date included)
'-b thismonth'      all transactions on or after the 1st of the current month
'-p thismonth'      all transactions in the current month
'date:2016/3/17-'   the above written as queries instead
'date:-12/1'
'date:thismonth-'
'date:thismonth'


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Report intervals,  Next: Period expressions,  Prev: Report start & end date,  Up: OPTIONS

2.8 Report intervals
====================

A report interval can be specified so that commands like register,
balance and activity will divide their reports into multiple subperiods.
The basic intervals can be selected with one of '-D/--daily',
'-W/--weekly', '-M/--monthly', '-Q/--quarterly', or '-Y/--yearly'.  More
complex intervals may be specified with a period expression.  Report
intervals can not be specified with a query, currently.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Period expressions,  Next: Depth limiting,  Prev: Report intervals,  Up: OPTIONS

2.9 Period expressions
======================

The '-p/--period' option accepts period expressions, a shorthand way of
expressing a start date, end date, and/or report interval all at once.

   Here's a basic period expression specifying the first quarter of
2009.  Note, hledger always treats start dates as inclusive and end
dates as exclusive:

   '-p "from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"'

   Keywords like "from" and "to" are optional, and so are the spaces, as
long as you don't run two dates together.  "to" can also be written as
"-".  These are equivalent to the above:

'-p "2009/1/1 2009/4/1"'
'-p2009/1/1to2009/4/1'
'-p2009/1/1-2009/4/1'

   Dates are smart dates, so if the current year is 2009, the above can
also be written as:

'-p "1/1 4/1"'
'-p "january-apr"'
'-p "this year to 4/1"'

   If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be
the earliest or latest transaction in your journal:

'-p "from 2009/1/1"'   everything after january 1, 2009
'-p "from 2009/1"'     the same
'-p "from 2009"'       the same
'-p "to 2009"'         everything before january 1, 2009

   A single date with no "from" or "to" defines both the start and end
date like so:

'-p "2009"'       the year 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2010/1/1"
'-p "2009/1"'     the month of jan; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/2/1"
'-p "2009/1/1"'   just that day; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/1/2"

   The argument of '-p' can also begin with, or be, a report interval
expression.  The basic report intervals are 'daily', 'weekly',
'monthly', 'quarterly', or 'yearly', which have the same effect as the
'-D','-W','-M','-Q', or '-Y' flags.  Between report interval and
start/end dates (if any), the word 'in' is optional.  Examples:

'-p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"'
'-p "monthly in 2008"'
'-p "quarterly"'

   The following more complex report intervals are also supported:
'biweekly', 'bimonthly', 'every N days|weeks|months|quarters|years',
'every Nth day [of month]', 'every Nth day of week'.

   Examples:

'-p "bimonthly from 2008"'
'-p "every 2 weeks"'
'-p "every 5 days from 1/3"'

   Show historical balances at end of 15th each month (N is exclusive
end date):

   'hledger balance -H -p "every 16th day"'

   Group postings from start of wednesday to end of next tuesday (N is
start date and exclusive end date):

   'hledger register checking -p "every 3rd day of week"'

2.10 Depth limiting
===================

With the '--depth N' option, commands like account, balance and register
will show only the uppermost accounts in the account tree, down to level
N. Use this when you want a summary with less detail.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Pivoting,  Next: Cost,  Prev: Depth limiting,  Up: OPTIONS

2.11 Pivoting
=============

Normally hledger sums amounts, and organizes them in a hierarchy, based
on account name.  The '--pivot TAGNAME' option causes it to sum and
organize hierarchy based on some other field instead.

   TAGNAME is the full, case-insensitive name of a tag you have defined,
or one of the built-in implicit tags (like 'code' or 'payee').  As with
account names, when tag values have 'multiple:colon-separated:parts'
hledger will build hierarchy, displayed in tree-mode reports,
summarisable with a depth limit, and so on.

   '--pivot' is a general option affecting all reports; you can think of
hledger transforming the journal before any other processing, replacing
every posting's account name with the value of the specified tag on that
posting, inheriting it from the transaction or using a blank value if
it's not present.

   An example:

2016/02/16 Member Fee Payment
    assets:bank account                    2 EUR
    income:member fees                    -2 EUR  ; member: John Doe

   Normal balance report showing account names:

$ hledger balance
               2 EUR  assets:bank account
              -2 EUR  income:member fees
--------------------
                   0

   Pivoted balance report, using member: tag values instead:

$ hledger balance --pivot member
               2 EUR
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
                   0

   One way to show only amounts with a member: value (using a query,
described below):

$ hledger balance --pivot member tag:member=.
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
              -2 EUR

   Another way (the acct: query matches against the pivoted "account
name"):

$ hledger balance --pivot member acct:.
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
              -2 EUR


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Cost,  Next: Market value,  Prev: Pivoting,  Up: OPTIONS

2.12 Cost
=========

The '-B/--cost' flag converts amounts to their cost at transaction time,
if they have a transaction price specified.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Market value,  Next: Regular expressions,  Prev: Cost,  Up: OPTIONS

2.13 Market value
=================

The '-V/--value' flag converts the reported amounts to their market
value on the report end date, using the most recent applicable market
prices, when known.  Specifically, when there is a market price (P
directive) for the amount's commodity, dated on or before the report end
date (see hledger -> Report start & end date), the amount will be
converted to the price's commodity.  If multiple applicable prices are
defined, the latest-dated one is used (and if dates are equal, the one
last parsed).

   For example:

# one euro is worth this many dollars from nov 1
P 2016/11/01 € $1.10

# purchase some euros on nov 3
2016/11/3
    assets:euros        €100
    assets:checking

# the euro is worth fewer dollars by dec 21
P 2016/12/21 € $1.03

   How many euros do I have ?

$ hledger -f t.j bal euros
                €100  assets:euros

   What are they worth on nov 3 ?  (no report end date specified,
defaults to the last date in the journal)

$ hledger -f t.j bal euros -V
             $110.00  assets:euros

   What are they worth on dec 21 ?

$ hledger -f t.j bal euros -V -e 2016/12/21
             $103.00  assets:euros

   Currently, hledger's -V only uses market prices recorded with P
directives, not transaction prices (unlike Ledger).

   Using -B and -V together is allowed.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Regular expressions,  Prev: Market value,  Up: OPTIONS

2.14 Regular expressions
========================

hledger uses regular expressions in a number of places:

   * query terms, on the command line and in the hledger-web search
     form: 'REGEX', 'desc:REGEX', 'cur:REGEX', 'tag:...=REGEX'
   * CSV rules conditional blocks: 'if REGEX ...'
   * account alias directives and options: 'alias /REGEX/ =
     REPLACEMENT', '--alias /REGEX/=REPLACEMENT'

   hledger's regular expressions come from the regex-tdfa library.  In
general they:

   * are case insensitive
   * are infix matching (do not need to match the entire thing being
     matched)
   * are POSIX extended regular expressions
   * also support GNU word boundaries (\<, \>, \b, \B)
   * and parenthesised capturing groups and numeric backreferences in
     replacement strings
   * do not support mode modifiers like (?s)

   Some things to note:

   * In the 'alias' directive and '--alias' option, regular expressions
     must be enclosed in forward slashes ('/REGEX/').  Elsewhere in
     hledger, these are not required.

   * In queries, to match a regular expression metacharacter like '$' as
     a literal character, prepend a backslash.  Eg to search for amounts
     with the dollar sign in hledger-web, write 'cur:\$'.

   * On the command line, some metacharacters like '$' have a special
     meaning to the shell and so must be escaped at least once more.
     See Special characters.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: QUERIES,  Next: COMMANDS,  Prev: OPTIONS,  Up: Top

3 QUERIES
*********

One of hledger's strengths is being able to quickly report on precise
subsets of your data.  Most commands accept an optional query
expression, written as arguments after the command name, to filter the
data by date, account name or other criteria.  The syntax is similar to
a web search: one or more space-separated search terms, quotes to
enclose whitespace, optional prefixes to match specific fields.
Multiple search terms are combined as follows:

   All commands except print: show transactions/postings/accounts which
match (or negatively match)

   * any of the description terms AND
   * any of the account terms AND
   * any of the status terms AND
   * all the other terms.

   The print command: show transactions which

   * match any of the description terms AND
   * have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND
   * have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND
   * match all the other terms.

   The following kinds of search terms can be used:

*'REGEX'*

     match account names by this regular expression
*'acct:REGEX'*

     same as above
*'amt:N, amt:<N, amt:<=N, amt:>N, amt:>=N'*

     match postings with a single-commodity amount that is equal to,
     less than, or greater than N. (Multi-commodity amounts are not
     tested, and will always match.)  The comparison has two modes: if N
     is preceded by a + or - sign (or is 0), the two signed numbers are
     compared.  Otherwise, the absolute magnitudes are compared,
     ignoring sign.
*'code:REGEX'*

     match by transaction code (eg check number)
*'cur:REGEX'*

     match postings or transactions including any amounts whose
     currency/commodity symbol is fully matched by REGEX. (For a partial
     match, use '.*REGEX.*').  Note, to match characters which are
     regex-significant, like the dollar sign ('$'), you need to prepend
     '\'.  And when using the command line you need to add one more
     level of quoting to hide it from the shell, so eg do: 'hledger
     print cur:'\$'' or 'hledger print cur:\\$'.
*'desc:REGEX'*

     match transaction descriptions
*'date:PERIODEXPR'*

     match dates within the specified period.  PERIODEXPR is a period
     expression (with no report interval).  Examples: 'date:2016',
     'date:thismonth', 'date:2000/2/1-2/15', 'date:lastweek-'.  If the
     '--date2' command line flag is present, this matches secondary
     dates instead.
*'date2:PERIODEXPR'*

     match secondary dates within the specified period.
*'depth:N'*

     match (or display, depending on command) accounts at or above this
     depth
*'real:, real:0'*

     match real or virtual postings respectively
*'status:, status:!, status:*'*

     match unmarked, pending, or cleared transactions respectively
*'tag:REGEX[=REGEX]'*

     match by tag name, and optionally also by tag value.  Note a tag:
     query is considered to match a transaction if it matches any of the
     postings.  Also remember that postings inherit the tags of their
     parent transaction.
*'not:'*

     before any of the above negates the match.
*'inacct:ACCTNAME'*

     a special term used automatically when you click an account name in
     hledger-web, specifying the account register we are currently in
     (selects the transactions of that account and how to show them, can
     be filtered further with 'acct' etc).  Not supported elsewhere in
     hledger.

   Some of these can also be expressed as command-line options (eg
'depth:2' is equivalent to '--depth 2').  Generally you can mix options
and query arguments, and the resulting query will be their intersection
(perhaps excluding the '-p/--period' option).

4 COMMANDS
**********

hledger provides a number of subcommands; 'hledger' with no arguments
shows a list.

   If you install additional 'hledger-*' packages, or if you put
programs or scripts named 'hledger-NAME' in your PATH, these will also
be listed as subcommands.

   Run a subcommand by writing its name as first argument (eg 'hledger
incomestatement').  You can also write any unambiguous prefix of a
command name ('hledger inc'), or one of the standard short aliases
displayed in the command list ('hledger is').

4.1 accounts
============

Show account names.

'--tree'

     show short account names, as a tree
'--flat'

     show full account names, as a list (default)
'--drop=N'

     in flat mode: omit N leading account name parts

   This command lists all account names that are in use (ie, all the
accounts which have at least one transaction posting to them).  With
query arguments, only matched account names are shown.

   It shows a flat list by default.  With '--tree', it uses indentation
to show the account hierarchy.

   In flat mode you can add '--drop N' to omit the first few account
name components.

   Examples:

$ hledger accounts --tree
assets
  bank
    checking
    saving
  cash
expenses
  food
  supplies
income
  gifts
  salary
liabilities
  debts

$ hledger accounts --drop 1

4.2 activity
============

Show an ascii barchart of posting counts per interval.

   The activity command displays an ascii histogram showing transaction
counts by day, week, month or other reporting interval (by day is the
default).  With query arguments, it counts only matched transactions.

$ hledger activity --quarterly
2008-01-01 **
2008-04-01 *******

2008-10-01 **


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: add,  Next: balance,  Prev: activity,  Up: COMMANDS

4.3 add
=======

Prompt for transactions and add them to the journal.

'--no-new-accounts'

     don't allow creating new accounts; helps prevent typos when
     entering account names

   Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor,
or generate them from CSV. For more interactive data entry, there is the
'add' command, which prompts interactively on the console for new
transactions, and appends them to the journal file (if there are
multiple '-f FILE' options, the first file is used.)  Existing
transactions are not changed.  This is the only hledger command that
writes to the journal file.

   To use it, just run 'hledger add' and follow the prompts.  You can
add as many transactions as you like; when you are finished, enter '.'
or press control-d or control-c to exit.

   Features:

   * add tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar recent
     transaction (by description) as a template.
   * You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.
   * Readline-style edit keys can be used during data entry.
   * The tab key will auto-complete whenever possible - accounts,
     descriptions, dates ('yesterday', 'today', 'tomorrow').  If the
     input area is empty, it will insert the default value.
   * If the journal defines a default commodity, it will be added to any
     bare numbers entered.
   * A parenthesised transaction code may be entered following a date.
   * Comments and tags may be entered following a description or amount.
   * If you make a mistake, enter '<' at any prompt to restart the
     transaction.
   * Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when the terminal
     supports it.

   Example (see the tutorial for a detailed explanation):

$ hledger add
Adding transactions to journal file /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to restart the transaction.
To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control-d or control-c.
Date [2015/05/22]:
Description: supermarket
Account 1: expenses:food
Amount  1: $10
Account 2: assets:checking
Amount  2 [$-10.0]:
Account 3 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
2015/05/22 supermarket

4.4 balance
===========

Show accounts and their balances.  Alias: bal.

'--change'

     show balance change in each period (default)
'--cumulative'

     show balance change accumulated across periods (in multicolumn
     reports)
'-H --historical'

     show historical ending balance in each period (includes postings
     before report start date)
'--tree'

     show accounts as a tree; amounts include subaccounts (default in
     simple reports)
'--flat'

     show accounts as a list; amounts exclude subaccounts except when
     account is depth-clipped (default in multicolumn reports)
'-A --average'

     show a row average column (in multicolumn mode)
'-T --row-total'

     show a row total column (in multicolumn mode)
'-N --no-total'

     don't show the final total row
'--drop=N'

     omit N leading account name parts (in flat mode)
'--no-elide'

     don't squash boring parent accounts (in tree mode)
'--format=LINEFORMAT'

     in single-column balance reports: use this custom line format
'-O FMT --output-format=FMT'

     select the output format.  Supported formats: txt, csv.
'-o FILE --output-file=FILE'

     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.
'--pretty-tables'

     Use unicode to display prettier tables.

   The balance command displays accounts and balances.  It is hledger's
most featureful and versatile command.

$ hledger balance
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0

   More precisely, the balance command shows the _change_ to each
account's balance caused by all (matched) postings.  In the common case
where you do not filter by date and your journal sets the correct
opening balances, this is the same as the account's ending balance.

   By default, accounts are displayed hierarchically, with subaccounts
indented below their parent.  "Boring" accounts, which contain a single
interesting subaccount and no balance of their own, are elided into the
following line for more compact output.  (Use '--no-elide' to prevent
this.  Eliding of boring accounts is not yet supported in multicolumn
reports.)

   Each account's balance is the "inclusive" balance - it includes the
balances of any subaccounts.

   Accounts which have zero balance (and no non-zero subaccounts) are
omitted.  Use '-E/--empty' to show them.

   A final total is displayed by default; use '-N/--no-total' to
suppress it:

$ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses --no-total
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies

File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Flat mode,  Next: Depth limited balance reports,  Up: balance

4.4.1 Flat mode
---------------

To see a flat list of full account names instead of the default
hierarchical display, use '--flat'.  In this mode, accounts (unless
depth-clipped) show their "exclusive" balance, excluding any subaccount
balances.  In this mode, you can also use '--drop N' to omit the first
few account name components.

$ hledger balance -p 2008/6 expenses -N --flat --drop 1
                  $1  food
                  $1  supplies


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Depth limited balance reports,  Next: Multicolumn balance reports,  Prev: Flat mode,  Up: balance

4.4.2 Depth limited balance reports
-----------------------------------

With '--depth N', balance shows accounts only to the specified depth.
This is very useful to show a complex charts of accounts in less detail.
In flat mode, balances from accounts below the depth limit will be shown
as part of a parent account at the depth limit.

$ hledger balance -N --depth 1
                 $-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $-2  income
                  $1  liabilities


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Multicolumn balance reports,  Next: Custom balance output,  Prev: Depth limited balance reports,  Up: balance

4.4.3 Multicolumn balance reports
---------------------------------

With a reporting interval, multiple balance columns will be shown, one
for each report period.  There are three types of multi-column balance
report, showing different information:

  1. By default: each column shows the sum of postings in that period,
     ie the account's change of balance in that period.  This is useful
     eg for a monthly income statement:

     $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E
     Balance changes in 2008:

                        ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4
     ===================++=================================
      expenses:food     ||       0      $1       0       0
      expenses:supplies ||       0      $1       0       0
      income:gifts      ||       0     $-1       0       0
      income:salary     ||     $-1       0       0       0
     -------------------++---------------------------------
                        ||     $-1      $1       0       0

  2. With '--cumulative': each column shows the ending balance for that
     period, accumulating the changes across periods, starting from 0 at
     the report start date:

     $ hledger balance --quarterly income expenses -E --cumulative
     Ending balances (cumulative) in 2008:

                        ||  2008/03/31  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31
     ===================++=================================================
      expenses:food     ||           0          $1          $1          $1
      expenses:supplies ||           0          $1          $1          $1
      income:gifts      ||           0         $-1         $-1         $-1
      income:salary     ||         $-1         $-1         $-1         $-1
     -------------------++-------------------------------------------------
                        ||         $-1           0           0           0

  3. With '--historical/-H': each column shows the actual historical
     ending balance for that period, accumulating the changes across
     periods, starting from the actual balance at the report start date.
     This is useful eg for a multi-period balance sheet, and when you
     are showing only the data after a certain start date:

     $ hledger balance ^assets ^liabilities --quarterly --historical --begin 2008/4/1
     Ending balances (historical) in 2008/04/01-2008/12/31:

                           ||  2008/06/30  2008/09/30  2008/12/31
     ======================++=====================================
      assets:bank:checking ||          $1          $1           0
      assets:bank:saving   ||          $1          $1          $1
      assets:cash          ||         $-2         $-2         $-2
      liabilities:debts    ||           0           0          $1
     ----------------------++-------------------------------------
                           ||           0           0           0

   Multi-column balance reports display accounts in flat mode by
default; to see the hierarchy, use '--tree'.

   With a reporting interval (like '--quarterly' above), the report
start/end dates will be adjusted if necessary so that they encompass the
displayed report periods.  This is so that the first and last periods
will be "full" and comparable to the others.

   The '-E/--empty' flag does two things in multicolumn balance reports:
first, the report will show all columns within the specified report
period (without -E, leading and trailing columns with all zeroes are not
shown).  Second, all accounts which existed at the report start date
will be considered, not just the ones with activity during the report
period (use -E to include low-activity accounts which would otherwise
would be omitted).

   The '-T/--row-total' flag adds an additional column showing the total
for each row.

   The '-A/--average' flag adds a column showing the average value in
each row.

   Here's an example of all three:

$ hledger balance -Q income expenses --tree -ETA
Balance changes in 2008:

            ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4    Total  Average
============++===================================================
 expenses   ||       0      $2       0       0       $2       $1
   food     ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0
   supplies ||       0      $1       0       0       $1        0
 income     ||     $-1     $-1       0       0      $-2      $-1
   gifts    ||       0     $-1       0       0      $-1        0
   salary   ||     $-1       0       0       0      $-1        0
------------++---------------------------------------------------
            ||     $-1      $1       0       0        0        0

# Average is rounded to the dollar here since all journal amounts are


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Custom balance output,  Next: Colour support,  Prev: Multicolumn balance reports,  Up: balance

4.4.4 Custom balance output
---------------------------

In simple (non-multi-column) balance reports, you can customise the
output with '--format FMT':

$ hledger balance --format "%20(account) %12(total)"
              assets          $-1
         bank:saving           $1
                cash          $-2
            expenses           $2
                food           $1
            supplies           $1
              income          $-2
               gifts          $-1
              salary          $-1
   liabilities:debts           $1
---------------------------------
                                0

   The FMT format string (plus a newline) specifies the formatting
applied to each account/balance pair.  It may contain any suitable text,
with data fields interpolated like so:

   '%[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)'

   * MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)
   * MAX truncates at this width (optional)
   * FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:

        * 'depth_spacer' - a number of spaces equal to the account's
          depth, or if MIN is specified, MIN * depth spaces.
        * 'account' - the account's name
        * 'total' - the account's balance/posted total, right justified

   Also, FMT can begin with an optional prefix to control how
multi-commodity amounts are rendered:

   * '%_' - render on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)
   * '%^' - render on multiple lines, top-aligned
   * '%,' - render on one line, comma-separated

   There are some quirks.  Eg in one-line mode, '%(depth_spacer)' has no
effect, instead '%(account)' has indentation built in.  Experimentation
may be needed to get pleasing results.

   Some example formats:

   * '%(total)' - the account's total
   * '%-20.20(account)' - the account's name, left justified, padded to
     20 characters and clipped at 20 characters
   * '%,%-50(account) %25(total)' - account name padded to 50
     characters, total padded to 20 characters, with multiple
     commodities rendered on one line
   * '%20(total) %2(depth_spacer)%-(account)' - the default format for
     the single-column balance report

File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Output destination,  Next: CSV output,  Prev: Colour support,  Up: balance

4.4.6 Output destination
------------------------

The balance, print, register and stats commands can write their output
to a destination other than the console.  This is controlled by the
'-o/--output-file' option.

$ hledger balance -o -     # write to stdout (the default)
$ hledger balance -o FILE  # write to FILE


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: CSV output,  Prev: Output destination,  Up: balance

4.4.7 CSV output
----------------

The balance, print and register commands can write their output as CSV.
This is useful for exporting data to other applications, eg to make
charts in a spreadsheet.  This is controlled by the '-O/--output-format'
option, or by specifying a '.csv' file extension with
'-o/--output-file'.

$ hledger balance -O csv       # write CSV to stdout
$ hledger balance -o FILE.csv  # write CSV to FILE.csv

4.5 balancesheet
================

Show a balance sheet.  Alias: bs.

'--change'

     show balance change in each period, instead of historical ending
     balances
'--cumulative'

     show balance change accumulated across periods (in multicolumn
     reports), instead of historical ending balances
'-H --historical'

     show historical ending balance in each period (includes postings
     before report start date) (default)
'--tree'

     show accounts as a tree; amounts include subaccounts (default in
     simple reports)
'--flat'

     show accounts as a list; amounts exclude subaccounts except when
     account is depth-clipped (default in multicolumn reports)
'-A --average'

     show a row average column (in multicolumn mode)
'-T --row-total'

     show a row total column (in multicolumn mode)
'-N --no-total'

     don't show the final total row
'--drop=N'

     omit N leading account name parts (in flat mode)
'--no-elide'

     don't squash boring parent accounts (in tree mode)
'--format=LINEFORMAT'

     in single-column balance reports: use this custom line format

   This command displays a simple balance sheet.  It currently assumes
that you have top-level accounts named 'asset' and 'liability' (plural
forms also allowed.)

$ hledger balancesheet
Balance Sheet

Assets:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Liabilities:
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                  $1

Total:
--------------------
                   0

   With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for
each report period.  As with multicolumn balance reports, you can alter
the report mode with '--change'/'--cumulative'/'--historical'.  Normally
balancesheet shows historical ending balances, which is what you need
for a balance sheet; note this means it ignores report begin dates.

======================

Show a balance sheet including equity.  Alias: bse.

   Other than showing the equity accounts, this command is exactly the
same as the command balancesheet.  Please refer to it for the available

Show a cashflow statement.  Alias: cf.

'--change'

     show balance change in each period (default)
'--cumulative'

     show balance change accumulated across periods (in multicolumn
     reports), instead of changes during periods
'-H --historical'

     show historical ending balance in each period (includes postings
     before report start date), instead of changes during each period
'--tree'

     show accounts as a tree; amounts include subaccounts (default in
     simple reports)
'--flat'

     show accounts as a list; amounts exclude subaccounts except when
     account is depth-clipped (default in multicolumn reports)
'-A --average'

     show a row average column (in multicolumn mode)
'-T --row-total'

     show a row total column (in multicolumn mode)
'-N --no-total'

     don't show the final total row (in simple reports)
'--drop=N'

     omit N leading account name parts (in flat mode)
'--no-elide'

     don't squash boring parent accounts (in tree mode)
'--format=LINEFORMAT'

     in single-column balance reports: use this custom line format

   This command displays a simple cashflow statement It shows the change
in all "cash" (ie, liquid assets) accounts for the period.  It currently
assumes that cash accounts are under a top-level account named 'asset'
and do not contain 'receivable', ':A/R' or ':fixed'.

$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement

Cash flows:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Total:
--------------------
                 $-1

   With a reporting interval, multiple columns will be shown, one for
each report period.  Normally cashflow shows changes in assets per
period, though as with multicolumn balance reports you can alter the
report mode with '--change'/'--cumulative'/'--historical'.

4.8 help
========

Show any of the hledger manuals.

   The 'help' command displays any of the main hledger manuals, in one
of several ways.  Run it with no argument to list the manuals, or
provide a full or partial manual name to select one.

   hledger manuals are available in several formats.  hledger help will
use the first of these display methods that it finds: info, man, $PAGER,
less, stdout (or when non-interactive, just stdout).  You can force a
particular viewer with the '--info', '--man', '--pager', '--cat' flags.

4.10 print
==========

Show transactions from the journal.

'-x --explicit'

'-m STR --match=STR'

     show the transaction whose description is most similar to STR, and
     is most recent
'-O FMT --output-format=FMT'

     select the output format.  Supported formats: txt, csv.
'-o FILE --output-file=FILE'

     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.

$ hledger print

    assets:bank:checking           $-1

   The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from
the journal file, tidily formatted.

   As of hledger 1.2, print's output is always a valid hledger journal.
However it may not preserve all original content, eg it does not print
directives or inter-transaction comments.

   Normally, transactions' implicit/explicit amount style is preserved:
when an amount is omitted in the journal, it will be omitted in the
output.  You can use the '-x/--explicit' flag to make all amounts
explicit, which can be useful for troubleshooting or for making your
journal more readable and robust against data entry errors.  Note, in
this mode postings with a multi-commodity amount (possible with an
implicit amount in a multi-commodity transaction) will be split into
multiple single-commodity postings, for valid journal output.

   With -B/-cost, amounts with transaction prices are converted to cost
(using the transaction price).

   The print command also supports output destination and CSV output.
Here's an example of print's CSV output:

$ hledger print -Ocsv
"txnidx","date","date2","status","code","description","comment","account","amount","commodity","credit","debit","posting-status","posting-comment"
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","income:salary","-1","$","1","","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","income:gifts","-1","$","1","","",""
"3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:saving","1","$","","1","",""
"3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:food","1","$","","1","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:supplies","1","$","","1","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","assets:cash","-2","$","2","","",""
"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","liabilities:debts","1","$","","1","",""
"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""

   * There is one CSV record per posting, with the parent transaction's
     fields repeated.
   * The "txnidx" (transaction index) field shows which postings belong
     to the same transaction.  (This number might change if transactions
     are reordered within the file, files are parsed/included in a
     different order, etc.)
   * The amount is separated into "commodity" (the symbol) and "amount"
     (numeric quantity) fields.
   * The numeric amount is repeated in either the "credit" or "debit"
     column, for convenience.  (Those names are not accurate in the
     accounting sense; it just puts negative amounts under credit and
     zero or greater amounts under debit.)


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: register,  Next: stats,  Prev: print,  Up: COMMANDS

4.11 register
=============

Show postings and their running total.  Alias: reg.

'--cumulative'

     show running total from report start date (default)
'-H --historical'

     show historical running total/balance (includes postings before
     report start date)
'-A --average'

     show running average of posting amounts instead of total (implies
     -empty)
'-r --related'

     show postings' siblings instead
'-w N --width=N'

     set output width (default: terminal width or COLUMNS. -wN,M sets
     description width as well)
'-O FMT --output-format=FMT'

     select the output format.  Supported formats: txt, csv.
'-o FILE --output-file=FILE'

     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.

   The register command displays postings, one per line, and their
running total.  This is typically used with a query selecting a
particular account, to see that account's activity:

$ hledger register checking
2008/01/01 income               assets:bank:checking            $1            $1
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1            $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1            $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1             0

   The '--historical'/'-H' flag adds the balance from any undisplayed
prior postings to the running total.  This is useful when you want to
see only recent activity, with a historically accurate running balance:

$ hledger register checking -b 2008/6 --historical
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1            $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1            $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1             0

   The '--depth' option limits the amount of sub-account detail
displayed.

   The '--average'/'-A' flag shows the running average posting amount
instead of the running total (so, the final number displayed is the
average for the whole report period).  This flag implies '--empty' (see
below).  It is affected by '--historical'.  It works best when showing
just one account and one commodity.

   The '--related'/'-r' flag shows the _other_ postings in the
transactions of the postings which would normally be shown.

   With a reporting interval, register shows summary postings, one per
interval, aggregating the postings to each account:

$ hledger register --monthly income
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1           $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1           $-2

   Periods with no activity, and summary postings with a zero amount,
are not shown by default; use the '--empty'/'-E' flag to see them:

$ hledger register --monthly income -E
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1           $-1
2008/02                                                          0           $-1
2008/03                                                          0           $-1
2008/04                                                          0           $-1
2008/05                                                          0           $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1           $-2
2008/07                                                          0           $-2
2008/08                                                          0           $-2
2008/09                                                          0           $-2
2008/10                                                          0           $-2
2008/11                                                          0           $-2
2008/12                                                          0           $-2

   Often, you'll want to see just one line per interval.  The '--depth'
option helps with this, causing subaccounts to be aggregated:

$ hledger register --monthly assets --depth 1h
2008/01                 assets                                  $1            $1
2008/06                 assets                                 $-1             0
2008/12                 assets                                 $-1           $-1

   Note when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates
these will be adjusted outward if necessary to contain a whole number of
intervals.  This ensures that the first and last intervals are full
length and comparable to the others in the report.
* Menu:

* Custom register output::


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: Custom register output,  Up: register

4.11.1 Custom register output
-----------------------------

register uses the full terminal width by default, except on windows.
You can override this by setting the 'COLUMNS' environment variable (not
a bash shell variable) or by using the '--width'/'-w' option.

   The description and account columns normally share the space equally
(about half of (width - 40) each).  You can adjust this by adding a
description width as part of -width's argument, comma-separated:
'--width W,D' .  Here's a diagram:

<--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA

   and some examples:

$ hledger reg                     # use terminal width (or 80 on windows)
$ hledger reg -w 100              # use width 100
$ COLUMNS=100 hledger reg         # set with one-time environment variable
$ export COLUMNS=100; hledger reg # set till session end (or window resize)
$ hledger reg -w 100,40           # set overall width 100, description width 40
$ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,40      # use terminal width, and set description width

   The register command also supports the '-o/--output-file' and
'-O/--output-format' options for controlling output destination and CSV
output.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: stats,  Next: test,  Prev: register,  Up: COMMANDS

4.12 stats
==========

Show some journal statistics.

'-o FILE --output-file=FILE'

     write output to FILE. A file extension matching one of the above
     formats selects that format.

$ hledger stats
Main journal file        : /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
Included journal files   :
Transactions span        : 2008-01-01 to 2009-01-01 (366 days)
Last transaction         : 2008-12-31 (2333 days ago)
Transactions             : 5 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions      : 5
Accounts                 : 8 (depth 3)
Commodities              : 1 ($)

   The stats command displays summary information for the whole journal,
or a matched part of it.  With a reporting interval, it shows a report
for each report period.

   The stats command also supports '-o/--output-file' for controlling
output destination.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: test,  Prev: stats,  Up: COMMANDS

4.13 test
=========

Run built-in unit tests.

$ hledger test
Cases: 74  Tried: 74  Errors: 0  Failures: 0

   This command runs hledger's built-in unit tests and displays a quick
report.  With a regular expression argument, it selects only tests with
matching names.  It's mainly used in development, but it's also nice to
be able to check your hledger executable for smoke at any time.


File: hledger.1.info,  Node: ADD-ON COMMANDS,  Prev: COMMANDS,  Up: Top

5 ADD-ON COMMANDS
*****************

hledger also searches for external add-on commands, and will include
these in the commands list.  These are programs or scripts in your PATH
whose name starts with 'hledger-' and ends with a recognised file
extension (currently: no extension, 'bat','com','exe',
'hs','lhs','pl','py','rb','rkt','sh').

   Add-ons can be invoked like any hledger command, but there are a few
things to be aware of.  Eg if the 'hledger-web' add-on is installed,

   * 'hledger -h web' shows hledger's help, while 'hledger web -h' shows
     hledger-web's help.

   * Flags specific to the add-on must have a preceding '--' to hide
     them from hledger.  So 'hledger web --serve --port 9000' will be
     rejected; you must use 'hledger web -- --serve --port 9000'.

   * You can always run add-ons directly if preferred: 'hledger-web
     --serve --port 9000'.

   Add-ons are a relatively easy way to add local features or experiment
with new ideas.  They can be written in any language, but haskell
scripts have a big advantage: they can use the same hledger (and
haskell) library functions that built-in commands do, for command-line
options, journal parsing, reporting, etc.

   Here are some hledger add-ons available:
