Most data types are defined here to avoid import cycles.
Here is an overview of the hledger data model:

> Journal                  -- a journal is read from one or more data files. It contains..
>  [Transaction]           -- journal transactions (aka entries), which have date, cleared status, code, description and..
>   [Posting]              -- multiple account postings, which have account name and amount
>  [MarketPrice]           -- historical market prices for commodities
>
> Ledger                   -- a ledger is derived from a journal, by applying a filter specification and doing some further processing. It contains..
>  Journal                 -- a filtered copy of the original journal, containing only the transactions and postings we are interested in
>  [Account]               -- all accounts, in tree order beginning with a "root" account", with their balances and sub/parent accounts

For more detailed documentation on each type, see the corresponding modules.
