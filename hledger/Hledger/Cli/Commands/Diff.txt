diff
Compares a particular account's transactions in two input files. It
shows any transactions to this account which are in one file but not in
the other.

More precisely, for each posting affecting this account in either file,
it looks for a corresponding posting in the other file which posts the
same amount to the same account (ignoring date, description, etc.) Since
postings not transactions are compared, this also works when multiple
bank transactions have been combined into a single journal entry.

This is useful eg if you have downloaded an account's transactions from
your bank (eg as CSV data). When hledger and your bank disagree about
the account balance, you can compare the bank data with your journal to
find out the cause.
