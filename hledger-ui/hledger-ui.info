hledger-ui(1)
*************

hledger-ui is a terminal interface (TUI) for the hledger accounting
tool.  This manual is for hledger-ui 1.28.99.

   'hledger-ui [OPTIONS] [QUERYARGS]'
'hledger ui -- [OPTIONS] [QUERYARGS]'

   hledger is a reliable, cross-platform set of programs for tracking
money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a
simple, editable file format.  hledger is inspired by and largely
compatible with ledger(1).

   hledger-ui is hledger's terminal interface, providing an efficient
full-window text UI for viewing accounts and transactions, and some
limited data entry capability.  It is easier than hledger's command-line
interface, and sometimes quicker and more convenient than the web
interface.

   Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger
journal, timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or
'$LEDGER_FILE', or '$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').  For more about this see hledger(1),
hledger_journal(5) etc.

   Unlike hledger, hledger-ui hides all future-dated transactions by
default.  They can be revealed, along with any rule-generated periodic
transactions, by pressing the F key (or starting with -forecast) to
enable "forecast mode".

     do extra error checking (check that all posted accounts are
     declared)

   hledger reporting options:

'-b --begin=DATE'

     include postings/txns on or after this date (will be adjusted to
     preceding subperiod start when using a report interval)
'-e --end=DATE'

     include postings/txns before this date (will be adjusted to
     following subperiod end when using a report interval)

     convert amounts to their market value in default valuation
     commodities
'-X --exchange=COMM'

     convert amounts to their market value in commodity COMM
'--value'

     convert amounts to cost or market value, more flexibly than
     -B/-V/-X

     prices, as if they were P directives
'--auto'

     apply automated posting rules to modify transactions.
'--forecast'

     generate future transactions from periodic transaction rules, for
     the next 6 months or till report end date.  In hledger-ui, also
     make ordinary future transactions visible.
'--commodity-style'

     Override the commodity style in the output for the specified
     commodity.  For example 'EUR1.000,00'.
'--color=WHEN (or --colour=WHEN)'

     Should color-supporting commands use ANSI color codes in text
     output.  'auto' (default): whenever stdout seems to be a
     color-supporting terminal.  'always' or 'yes': always, useful eg
     when piping output into 'less -R'. 'never' or 'no': never.  A
     NO_COLOR environment variable overrides this.
'--pretty[=WHEN]'

     Show prettier output, e.g.  using unicode box-drawing characters.
     Accepts 'yes' (the default) or 'no' ('y', 'n', 'always', 'never'
     also work).  If you provide an argument you must use '=', e.g.
     '-pretty=yes'.

   When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line,
the last one takes precedence.

   Some reporting options can also be written as query arguments.

   hledger help options:

'-h --help'

     show general or COMMAND help
'--man'

     show general or COMMAND user manual with man
'--info'

     show general or COMMAND user manual with info
'--version'

     show general or ADDONCMD version
'--debug[=N]'

     show debug output (levels 1-9, default: 1)

   A @FILE argument will be expanded to the contents of FILE, which
should contain one command line option/argument per line.  (To prevent
this, insert a '--' argument before.)


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: MOUSE,  Next: KEYS,  Prev: OPTIONS,  Up: Top

2 MOUSE
*******

In most modern terminals, you can navigate through the screens with a
mouse or touchpad:

   * Use mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll up and down
   * Click on list items to go deeper
   * Click on the left margin (column 0) to go back.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: KEYS,  Next: SCREENS,  Prev: MOUSE,  Up: Top

3 KEYS
******

Keyboard gives more control.

   '?' shows a help dialog listing all keys.  (Some of these also appear
in the quick help at the bottom of each screen.)  Press '?' again (or
'ESCAPE', or 'LEFT', or 'q') to close it.  The following keys work on
most screens:

   The cursor keys navigate: 'RIGHT' or 'ENTER' goes deeper, 'LEFT'
returns to the previous screen, 'UP'/'DOWN'/'PGUP'/'PGDN'/'HOME'/'END'
move up and down through lists.  Emacs-style
('CTRL-p'/'CTRL-n'/'CTRL-f'/'CTRL-b') and VI-style ('k','j','l','h')
movement keys are also supported.  A tip: movement speed is limited by
your keyboard repeat rate, to move faster you may want to adjust it.
(If you're on a mac, the karabiner app is one way to do that.)

   With shift pressed, the cursor keys adjust the report period,
limiting the transactions to be shown (by default, all are shown).
'SHIFT-DOWN/UP' steps downward and upward through these standard report
period durations: year, quarter, month, week, day.  Then,
'SHIFT-LEFT/RIGHT' moves to the previous/next period.  'T' sets the
report period to today.  With the '-w/--watch' option, when viewing a
"current" period (the current day, week, month, quarter, or year), the
period will move automatically to track the current date.  To set a
non-standard period, you can use '/' and a 'date:' query.

   '/' lets you set a general filter query limiting the data shown,
using the same query terms as in hledger and hledger-web.  While editing
the query, you can use CTRL-a/e/d/k, BS, cursor keys; press 'ENTER' to
set it, or 'ESCAPE'to cancel.  There are also keys for quickly adjusting
some common filters like account depth and transaction status (see
below).  'BACKSPACE' or 'DELETE' removes all filters, showing all
transactions.

   As mentioned above, by default hledger-ui hides future transactions -
both ordinary transactions recorded in the journal, and periodic
transactions generated by rule.  'F' toggles forecast mode, in which
future/forecasted transactions are shown.

   'ESCAPE' resets the UI state and jumps back to the top screen,
restoring the app's initial state at startup.  Or, it cancels minibuffer
data entry or the help dialog.

   'CTRL-l' redraws the screen and centers the selection if possible
(selections near the top won't be centered, since we don't scroll above
the top).

   'g' reloads from the data file(s) and updates the current screen and
any previous screens.  (With large files, this could cause a noticeable
pause.)

   'I' toggles balance assertion checking.  Disabling balance assertions
temporarily can be useful for troubleshooting.

   'a' runs command-line hledger's add command, and reloads the updated
file.  This allows some basic data entry.

   'A' is like 'a', but runs the hledger-iadd tool, which provides a
terminal interface.  This key will be available if 'hledger-iadd' is
installed in $path.

   'E' runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR, or $EDITOR, or a default ('emacsclient
-a "" -nw') on the journal file.  With some editors (emacs, vi), the
cursor will be positioned at the current transaction when invoked from
the register and transaction screens, and at the error location (if
possible) when invoked from the error screen.

   'B' toggles cost mode, showing amounts in their transaction price's
commodity (like toggling the '-B/--cost' flag).

   'V' toggles value mode, showing amounts' current market value in
their default valuation commodity (like toggling the '-V/--market'
flag).  Note, "current market value" means the value on the report end
date if specified, otherwise today.  To see the value on another date,
you can temporarily set that as the report end date.  Eg: to see a
transaction as it was valued on july 30, go to the accounts or register
screen, press '/', and add 'date:-7/30' to the query.

   At most one of cost or value mode can be active at once.

   There's not yet any visual reminder when cost or value mode is
active; for now pressing 'b' 'b' 'v' should reliably reset to normal
mode.

   'q' quits the application.

   Additional screen-specific keys are described below.

4 SCREENS
*********

hledger-ui shows several different screens, described below.  It shows
the "Balance sheet accounts" screen to start with, except in the
following situations:

   * If no asset/liability/equity accounts can be detected, or if an
     account query has been given on the command line, it starts in the
     "All accounts" screen.

   * If a starting screen is specified with -menu/-all/-bs/-is/-register
     on the command line, it starts in that screen.

   From any screen you can press 'LEFT' or 'ESC' to navigate back to the
top level "Menu" screen.

* Menu:

* Menu::
* All accounts::
* Balance sheet accounts::
* Income statement accounts::

File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Menu,  Next: All accounts,  Up: SCREENS

4.1 Menu
========

The top-most screen.  From here you can navigate to three accounts
screens:


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: All accounts,  Next: Balance sheet accounts,  Prev: Menu,  Up: SCREENS

4.2 All accounts
================

This screen shows all accounts (possibly filtered by a query), and their
end balances on the date shown in the title bar (or their balance
changes in the period shown in the title bar, toggleable with 'H').  It
is like the 'hledger balance' command.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Balance sheet accounts,  Next: Income statement accounts,  Prev: All accounts,  Up: SCREENS

4.3 Balance sheet accounts
==========================

This screen shows asset, liability and equity accounts, if these can be
detected (see account types).  It always shows end balances.  It is like
the 'hledger balancesheetequity' command.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Income statement accounts,  Next: Register,  Prev: Balance sheet accounts,  Up: SCREENS

4.4 Income statement accounts
=============================

This screen shows revenue and expense accounts.  It always shows balance
changes.  It is like the 'hledger incomestatement' command.

   All of these accounts screens work in much the same way:

   They show accounts which have been posted to by transactions, as well
as accounts which have been declared with an account directive (except
for empty parent accounts).

   If you specify a query on the command line or with '/' in the app,
they show just the matched accounts, and the balances from matched
transactions.

   hledger-ui shows accounts with zero balances by default (unlike
command-line hledger).  To hide these, press 'z' to toggle nonzero mode.

   Account names are shown as a flat list by default; press 't' to
toggle tree mode.  In list mode, account balances are exclusive of
subaccounts, except where subaccounts are hidden by a depth limit (see
below).  In tree mode, all account balances are inclusive of
subaccounts.

   To see less detail, press a number key, '1' to '9', to set a depth
limit.  Or use '-' to decrease and '+'/'=' to increase the depth limit.
'0' shows even less detail, collapsing all accounts to a single total.
To remove the depth limit, set it higher than the maximum account depth,
or press 'ESCAPE'.

   'H' toggles between showing historical balances or period balances
(on the "All accounts" screen).  Historical balances (the default) are
ending balances at the end of the report period, taking into account all
transactions before that date (filtered by the filter query if any),
including transactions before the start of the report period.  In other
words, historical balances are what you would see on a bank statement
for that account (unless disturbed by a filter query).  Period balances
ignore transactions before the report start date, so they show the
change in balance during the report period.  They are more useful eg
when viewing a time log.

   'U' toggles filtering by unmarked status, including or excluding
unmarked postings in the balances.  Similarly, 'P' toggles pending
postings, and 'C' toggles cleared postings.  (By default, balances
include all postings; if you activate one or two status filters, only
those postings are included; and if you activate all three, the filter
is removed.)

   'R' toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

   Press 'RIGHT' to view an account's register screen, Or, 'LEFT' to see
the menu screen.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Register,  Next: Transaction,  Prev: Income statement accounts,  Up: SCREENS

4.5 Register
============

This screen shows the transactions affecting a particular account, like
a check register.  Each line represents one transaction and shows:

   * the other account(s) involved, in abbreviated form.  (If there are
     both real and virtual postings, it shows only the accounts affected
     by real postings.)

   * the overall change to the current account's balance; positive for
     an inflow to this account, negative for an outflow.

   * the running historical total or period total for the current
     account, after the transaction.  This can be toggled with 'H'.
     Similar to the accounts screen, the historical total is affected by
     transactions (filtered by the filter query) before the report start
     date, while the period total is not.  If the historical total is
     not disturbed by a filter query, it will be the running historical
     balance you would see on a bank register for the current account.

   Transactions affecting this account's subaccounts will be included in
the register if the accounts screen is in tree mode, or if it's in list
mode but this account has subaccounts which are not shown due to a depth
limit.  In other words, the register always shows the transactions
contributing to the balance shown on the accounts screen.  Tree
mode/list mode can be toggled with 't' here also.

   'U' toggles filtering by unmarked status, showing or hiding unmarked
transactions.  Similarly, 'P' toggles pending transactions, and 'C'
toggles cleared transactions.  (By default, transactions with all
statuses are shown; if you activate one or two status filters, only
those transactions are shown; and if you activate all three, the filter
is removed.)

   'R' toggles real mode, in which virtual postings are ignored.

   'z' toggles nonzero mode, in which only transactions posting a
nonzero change are shown (hledger-ui shows zero items by default, unlike
command-line hledger).

   Press 'RIGHT' to view the selected transaction in detail.


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Transaction,  Next: Error,  Prev: Register,  Up: SCREENS

4.6 Transaction
===============

This screen shows a single transaction, as a general journal entry,
similar to hledger's print command and journal format
(hledger_journal(5)).

   The transaction's date(s) and any cleared flag, transaction code,
description, comments, along with all of its account postings are shown.
Simple transactions have two postings, but there can be more (or in
certain cases, fewer).

   'UP' and 'DOWN' will step through all transactions listed in the
previous account register screen.  In the title bar, the numbers in
parentheses show your position within that account register.  They will
vary depending on which account register you came from (remember most
transactions appear in multiple account registers).  The #N number
preceding them is the transaction's position within the complete
unfiltered journal, which is a more stable id (at least until the next
reload).


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Error,  Prev: Transaction,  Up: SCREENS

4.7 Error
=========

This screen will appear if there is a problem, such as a parse error,
when you press g to reload.  Once you have fixed the problem, press g
again to reload and resume normal operation.  (Or, you can press escape
to cancel the reload attempt.)

5 TIPS
******

* Menu:

* Watch mode::
* Debug output::


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Watch mode,  Next: Debug output,  Up: TIPS

5.1 Watch mode
==============

One of hledger-ui's best features is the auto-reloading '-w/--watch'
mode.  With this flag, it will update the display automatically whenever
changes are saved to the data files.

   This is very useful when reconciling.  A good workflow is to have
your bank's online register open in a browser window, for reference; the
journal file open in an editor window; and hledger-ui in watch mode in a
terminal window, eg:

$ hledger-ui --watch --register checking -C

   As you mark things cleared in the editor, you can see the effect
immediately without having to context switch.  This leaves more mental
bandwidth for your accounting.  Of course you can still interact with
hledger-ui when needed, eg to toggle cleared mode, or to explore the
history.

   Here are some current limitations to be aware of:

   Changes might not be detected with certain editors, possibly
including Jetbrains IDEs, 'gedit', other Gnome applications; or on
certain unusual filesystems.  (#1617, #911).  To work around, reload
manually by pressing 'g' in the hledger-ui window.  (Or see #1617 for
another workaround, and let us know if it works for you.)

   CPU and memory usage can sometimes gradually increase, if 'hledger-ui
--watch' is left running for days.  (Possibly correlated with certain
platforms, many transactions, and/or large numbers of other files
present).  To work around, 'q'uit and restart it, or (where supported)
suspend ('CTRL-z') and restart it ('fg').


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: Debug output,  Prev: Watch mode,  Up: TIPS

5.2 Debug output
================

You can add '--debug[=N]' to the command line to log debug output.  This
will be logged to the file 'hledger-ui.log' in the current directory.  N
ranges from 1 (least output, the default) to 9 (maximum output).


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: ENVIRONMENT,  Next: FILES,  Prev: TIPS,  Up: Top

6 ENVIRONMENT
*************

*COLUMNS* The screen width to use.  Default: the full terminal width.

   *LEDGER_FILE* The journal file path when not specified with '-f'.

   On unix computers, the default value is: '~/.hledger.journal'.

   A more typical value is something like '~/finance/YYYY.journal',
where '~/finance' is a version-controlled finance directory and YYYY is
the current year.  Or, '~/finance/current.journal', where
current.journal is a symbolic link to YYYY.journal.

   The usual way to set this permanently is to add a command to one of
your shell's startup files (eg '~/.profile'):

export LEDGER_FILE=~/finance/current.journal`

   On some Mac computers, there is a more thorough way to set
environment variables, that will also affect applications started from
the GUI (eg, Emacs started from a dock icon): In
'~/.MacOSX/environment.plist', add an entry like:

{
  "LEDGER_FILE" : "~/finance/current.journal"
}

   For this to take effect you might need to 'killall Dock', or reboot.

   On Windows computers, the default value is probably
'C:\Users\YOURNAME\.hledger.journal'.  You can change this by running a
command like this in a powershell window (let us know if you need to be
an Administrator, and if this persists across a reboot):

> setx LEDGER_FILE "C:\Users\MyUserName\finance\2021.journal"

   Or, change it in settings: see
https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html.

7 FILES
*******

Reads data from one or more files in hledger journal, timeclock,
timedot, or CSV format specified with '-f', or '$LEDGER_FILE', or
'$HOME/.hledger.journal' (on windows, perhaps
'C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal').


File: hledger-ui.info,  Node: BUGS,  Prev: FILES,  Up: Top

8 BUGS
******

The need to precede options with '--' when invoked from hledger is
awkward.

   '-f-' doesn't work (hledger-ui can't read from stdin).

   '-V' affects only the accounts screen.

   When you press 'g', the current and all previous screens are
regenerated, which may cause a noticeable pause with large files.  Also
there is no visual indication that this is in progress.

   '--watch' is not yet fully robust.  It works well for normal usage,
but many file changes in a short time (eg saving the file thousands of
times with an editor macro) can cause problems at least on OSX. Symptoms
include: unresponsive UI, periodic resetting of the cursor position,
momentary display of parse errors, high CPU usage eventually subsiding,
and possibly a small but persistent build-up of CPU usage until the
program is restarted.

   Also, if you are viewing files mounted from another machine,
'-w/--watch' requires that both machine clocks are roughly in step.
