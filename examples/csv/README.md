# CSV rules library

Here we collect real-world [CSV rules files](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#csv),
which help hledger read many kinds of exported character-separated data.
If you've made one which might be useful to others, please add it here!

These aren't necessarily maintained, and may not work out of the box for you,
but at they are at least a good source of ideas and examples.

Other things related to CSV conversion can also be found here.
