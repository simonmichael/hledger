NAME
       Timeclock - the time logging format of timeclock.el, as read by hledger

DESCRIPTION
       hledger can read timeclock files.  As with Ledger, these are (a  subset
       of) timeclock.el's format, containing clock-in and clock-out entries as
       in the example below.  The date is a simple date.  The time  format  is
       HH:MM[:SS][+-ZZZZ].   Seconds and timezone are optional.  The timezone,
       if present, must be four digits and is ignored (currently the  time  is
       always interpreted as a local time).

              i 2015/03/30 09:00:00 some:account name  optional description after two spaces
              o 2015/03/30 09:20:00
              i 2015/03/31 22:21:45 another account
              o 2015/04/01 02:00:34

       hledger  treats  each  clock-in/clock-out pair as a transaction posting
       some number of hours to an account.  Or if the session spans more  than
       one  day, it is split into several transactions, one for each day.  For
       the above time log, hledger print generates these journal entries:

              $ hledger -f t.timeclock print
              2015/03/30 * optional description after two spaces
                  (some:account name)         0.33h

              2015/03/31 * 22:21-23:59
                  (another account)         1.64h

              2015/04/01 * 00:00-02:00
                  (another account)         2.01h

       Here is a sample.timeclock to download and some queries to try:

              $ hledger -f sample.timeclock balance                               # current time balances
              $ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p 2009/3                    # sessions in march 2009
              $ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p weekly --depth 1 --empty  # time summary by week

       To generate time logs, ie to clock in and clock out, you could:

       o use emacs and  the  built-in  timeclock.el,  or  the  extended  time-
         clock-x.el and perhaps the extras in ledgerutils.el

       o at the command line, use these bash aliases:

                alias ti="echo i `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` \$* >>$TIMELOG"
                alias to="echo o `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` >>$TIMELOG"

       o or use the old ti and to scripts in the ledger 2.x repository.  These
         rely on a "timeclock" executable which I think is just the  ledger  2
         executable renamed.
