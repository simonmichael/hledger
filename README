hledger User's Guide
====================

Welcome to hledger! 

hledger is a partial haskell clone of John Wiegley's "ledger" command-line
accounting tool. hledger generates ledger-compatible register & balance
reports from a plain text ledger file, allows precise batch-mode or
interactive querying, and demonstrates a pure functional implementation of
ledger.  For more information, see http://hledger.org .

Installation
------------

Platform binaries are not yet being published; you could try asking for
one on the #ledger channel. 

Building hledger requires GHC 6.8 or later (http://haskell.org/ghc).
hledger should work on any platform which GHC supports.
Also, installing hledger's dependencies easily requires cabal-install
version 0.6 or later (http://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html).
Once these tools are installed on your system, do::

 cabal update
 cabal install hledger [-fvty] [-fhapps]

The vty and happs flags are optional; they enable hledger's "ui" and "web"
commands respectively. vty is not available on the windows platform.

Usage
-----

hledger looks for your ledger file at ~/.ledger by default. To use a
different file, specify it with the LEDGER environment variable or -f
option (which may be - for standard input). Basic usage is::

 hledger [OPTIONS] [COMMAND [PATTERNS]]

COMMAND is one of balance, print, register, ui, web, test (defaulting to
balance). PATTERNS are zero or more regular expressions used to narrow the
results.  Here are some commands to try::

 export LEDGER=sample.ledger
 hledger --help                        # show usage & options
 hledger balance                       # all accounts with aggregated balances
 hledger bal --depth 1                 # only top-level accounts
 hledger register                      # transaction register
 hledger reg income                    # transactions to/from an income account
 hledger reg checking                  # checking transactions
 hledger reg desc:shop                 # transactions with shop in the description
 hledger histogram                     # transactions per day, or other interval
 hledger ui                            # interactive ui, if installed with -fvty
 hledger web                           # web ui, installed with -fhapps
 echo >new; hledger -f new add         # input transactions from the command line

Time reporting
--------------

hledger will also read timeclock.el-format timelog entries.  As a
convenience, if you invoke hledger via a link or copy named "hours", it
uses your timelog file (~/.timelog or $TIMELOG) by default.::

 hours [OPTIONS] [COMMAND [PATTERNS]]

Timelog entries look like this::

 i 2009/03/31 22:21:45 some:project
 o 2009/04/01 02:00:34

The clockin description is treated as an account name. Here are some
queries to try::

 ln -s `which hledger` ~/bin/hours      # add the "hours" symlink in your path
 export TIMELOG=sample.timelog
 hours                                  # time logged today, if any
 hours -p 'last month'                     # last month
 hours -p thisyear                         # the space is optional
 hours -p 'from 1/15' register proj        # project sessions since last jan 15
 hours -p 'weekly this year' reg --depth 1 # weekly time summary

Features
--------

This version of hledger mimics a subset of ledger 3.x, and adds some
features of its own. We currently support regular ledger entries, timelog
entries, multiple commodities, virtual transactions, account and
description patterns, the LEDGER environment variable, and these commands
and options::

   Commands:
   balance  [REGEXP]...   show balance totals for matching accounts
   register [REGEXP]...   show register of matching transactions
   print    [REGEXP]...   print all matching entries

   Basic options:
   -h, --help             show summarized help
   -f, --file FILE        read ledger data from FILE
 
   Report filtering:
   -b, --begin DATE       report on entries on or after this date
   -e, --end DATE         report on entries prior to this date
   -p, --period EXPR      report on entries during the specified period
                          and/or with the specified reporting interval
   -C, --cleared          report only on cleared entries
   -R, --real             report only on real (non-virtual) transactions
 
   Output customization:
   -B, --basis, --cost    report cost of commodities
   -d, --display EXPR     display only transactions matching EXPR (limited support)
   -E, --empty            show empty/zero things which are normally elided
   --no-total             balance report: hide the final total
   -W, --weekly           register report: show weekly summary
   -M, --monthly          register report: show monthly summary
   -Y, --yearly           register report: show yearly summary

   Misc:
   -V, --version          show version information
   -v, --verbose          show verbose test output
   --debug                show some debug output 
   --debug-no-ui          run ui commands with no output

We handle (almost) the full period expression syntax, and very limited
display expressions consisting of a simple date predicate. Also the
following new commands are supported::

   histogram              show a (textual) barchart of transaction counts
   add                    input transactions from the command line
   convert                convert CSV bank data to ledger journal format
   ui                     a simple interactive text ui (only on unix platforms)
   web                    a simple web ui
   test                   run self-tests

Other differences
.................

* hledger calls the "note" field "description"
* hledger recognises description and negative patterns by  "desc:" and "not:" prefixes,
  unlike ledger 3's free-form parser
* hledger keeps differently-priced amounts of the same commodity separate
* hledger doesn't require a space before command-line option values, eg: -f-
* hledger's weekly reporting intervals always start on mondays
* hledger shows start and end dates of the intervals requested, not just the span containing data
* hledger period expressions don't support "biweekly", "bimonthly", or "every N days/weeks/..." 
* hledger always shows timelog balances in hours
* hledger splits multi-day timelog sessions at midnight
* hledger register report always sorts transactions by date
* hledger doesn't show description comments as part of the description
* hledger print puts a blank line after the entry, not before it
* hledger doesn't print trailing spaces after amount-elided postings
