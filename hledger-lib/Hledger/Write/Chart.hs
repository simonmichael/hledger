{- |
A renderer-independent description of a chart, made from a report.

This is to charts what "Hledger.Write.Spreadsheet" is to tables:
each chart-capable report has an adapter that turns its report data into a 'Chart',
choosing a useful default chart for that report (see doc/PLAN-charts.md, "Smart defaults"),
and renderers turn a 'Chart' into text, SVG, CSV or JSON.

The model carries the report's own display information
(period headings, account display names, commodity display styles, the report title)
so that every renderer labels things exactly as the report's table would.
Signs are already as the report shows them (eg normal-balance flipping done by bs/is/cf).

Values are kept exact here ('Quantity'); renderers convert them to Double only for drawing.
