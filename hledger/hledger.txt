NAME
       hledger  -  a  robust, friendly plain text accounting app (command line
       version).

SYNOPSIS
       hledger
       or
       hledger COMMAND [OPTS] [ARGS]
       or
       hledger ADDONCMD [OPTS] -- [ADDONOPTS] [ADDONARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       hledger is a robust, user-friendly, cross-platform set of programs  for
       tracking  money,  time,  or any other commodity, using double-entry ac-
       counting and a simple, editable file format.  hledger  is  inspired  by
       and  largely  compatible  with  ledger(1), and largely interconvertible
       with beancount(1).

       This manual is for hledger's command line interface,  version  1.43.99.
       It also describes the common options, file formats and concepts used by
       all  hledger  programs.  It might accidentally teach you some bookkeep-
       ing/accounting as well!  You don't need to know everything in  here  to
       use  hledger productively, but when you have a question about function-
       ality, this doc should answer it.  It is detailed, so do skip ahead  or
       skim when needed.  You can read it on hledger.org, or as an info manual
       or  man  page  on your system.  You can also open a built-in copy, at a
       point of interest, by running
       hledger --man [CMD], hledger --info [CMD] or hledger help [TOPIC].

       (And for shorter help, try hledger --tldr [CMD].)

       The main function of the hledger CLI is to read plain  text  files  de-
       scribing financial transactions, crunch the numbers, and print a useful
       report  on  the  terminal (or save it as HTML, CSV, JSON or SQL).  Many
       reports are available, as subcommands.  hledger will also detect  other
       hledger-* executables as extra subcommands.

       hledger usually reads from (and appends to) a journal file specified by
       the     LEDGER_FILE     environment     variable     (defaulting     to
       $HOME/.hledger.journal); or you can specify files with -f options.   It
       can  also  read timeclock files, timedot files, or any CSV/SSV/TSV file
       with a date field.

       Here is a small journal file describing one transaction:

              2015-10-16 bought food
                expenses:food          $10
                assets:cash

       Transactions are dated movements of money (etc.)  between two  or  more
       accounts:  bank accounts, your wallet, revenue/expense categories, peo-
       ple, etc.  You can choose any account names you wish, using : to  indi-
       cate  subaccounts.   There  must be at least two spaces between account
       name and amount.  Positive amounts are inflow to that account  (debit),
       negatives  are  outflow  from it (credit).  (Some reports show revenue,
       liability and equity account balances as negative numbers as a  result;
       this is normal.)

       hledger's add command can help you add transactions, or you can install
       other data entry UIs like hledger-web or hledger-iadd.  For more exten-
       sive/efficient  changes,  use a text editor: Emacs + ledger-mode, VIM +
       vim-ledger, or VS Code + hledger-vscode  are  some  good  choices  (see
       https://hledger.org/editors.html).

       To  get  started,  run hledger add and follow the prompts, or save some
       entries like the above in  $HOME/.hledger.journal,  then  try  commands
       like:

              $ hledger print -x
              $ hledger aregister assets
              $ hledger balance
              $ hledger balancesheet
              $ hledger incomestatement

       Run  hledger  to  list  the commands.  See also the "Starting a journal
       file" and "Setting opening balances" sections in PART 5: COMMON TASKS.

PART 1: USER INTERFACE
Input
       hledger reads one or more data files, each time you run  it.   You  can
       specify a file with -f, like so

              $ hledger -f FILE [-f FILE2 ...] print

       Files  are  most  often  in hledger's journal format, with the .journal
       file extension (.hledger or .j also work); these files describe  trans-
       actions, like an accounting general journal.

       When  no  file is specified, hledger looks for .hledger.journal in your
       home directory.

       But most people prefer to keep financial files in a  dedicated  folder,
       perhaps  with  version control.  Also, starting a new journal file each
       year is common (it's not required, but helps keep things fast  and  or-
       ganised).  So we usually configure a different journal file, by setting
       the   LEDGER_FILE   environment   variable,  to  something  like  ~/fi-
       nance/2023.journal.  For more about how to do that on your system,  see
       Common tasks > Setting LEDGER_FILE.

   Text encoding
       hledger  expects  non-ascii  input  to be decodable with the system lo-
       cale's text encoding.  (For CSV/SSV/TSV files, this can  be  overridden
       by the encoding CSV rule.)

       So,  trying to read non-ascii files which have the wrong text encoding,
       or when no system locale is configured, will fail.  To fix  this,  con-
       figure  your  system  locale appropriately, and/or convert the files to
       your system's text encoding (using iconv  on  unix,  or  powershell  or
       notepad on Windows).  See Install: Text encoding for more tips.

       hledger's output will use the system locale's encoding.

       hledger's docs and example files mostly use UTF-8 encoding.

   Data formats
       Usually  the data file is in hledger's journal format, but it can be in
       any of the supported file formats, which currently are:

       Reader:         Reads:                              Automatically used  for
                                                           files with extensions:
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       journal         hledger  journal  files  and some   .journal  .j   .hledger
                       Ledger journals, for transactions   .ledger
       timeclock       timeclock files, for precise time   .timeclock
                       logging
       timedot         timedot  files,  for  approximate   .timedot
                       time logging
       csv             Comma- or  other  delimiter-sepa-   .csv
                       rated values, for data import
       ssv             Semicolon separated values          .ssv
       tsv             Tab separated values                .tsv
       rules           CSV/SSV/TSV/other  separated val-   .rules
                       ues, alternate way

       These formats are described in more detail below.

       hledger detects the format automatically based on the  file  extensions
       shown  above.   If  it  can't  recognise the file extension, it assumes
       journal format.  So for non-journal files,  it's  important  to  use  a
       recognised file extension, so as to either read successfully or to show
       relevant error messages.

       You  can also force a specific reader/format by prefixing the file path
       with the format and a colon.  Eg, to read a .dat  file  containing  tab
       separated values:

              $ hledger -f tsv:/some/file.dat stats

   Standard input
       The file name - means standard input:

              $ cat FILE | hledger -f- print

       If  reading non-journal data in this way, you'll need to write the for-
       mat as a prefix, like timeclock: here:

              $ echo 'i 2009/13/1 08:00:00' | hledger print -f timeclock:-

   Multiple files
       You can specify multiple -f options, to read multiple files as one  big
       journal.  When doing this, note that certain features (described below)
       will be affected:

       o Balance  assertions will not see the effect of transactions in previ-
         ous files.  (Usually this doesn't matter as each file  will  set  the
         corresponding opening balances.)

       o Some directives will not affect previous or subsequent files.

       If  needed,  you  can  work  around these by using a single parent file
       which includes the others, or concatenating the files into one, eg: cat
       a.journal b.journal | hledger -f- CMD.

   Strict mode
       hledger checks input files for valid data.  By default, the most impor-
       tant errors are detected, while  still  accepting  easy  journal  files
       without a lot of declarations:

       o Are the input files parseable, with valid syntax ?

       o Are all transactions balanced ?

       o Do all balance assertions pass ?

       With the -s/--strict flag, additional checks are performed:

       o Are  all  accounts  posted  to,  declared with an account directive ?
         (Account error checking)

       o Are all commodities declared with a commodity directive ?  (Commodity
         error checking)

       o Are all commodity conversions declared explicitly ?

       You can use the check command to run  individual  checks  --  the  ones
       listed above and some more.

Commands
       hledger  provides various subcommands for getting things done.  Most of
       these commands do not change the journal file; they just  read  it  and
       output  a report.  A few commands assist with adding data and file man-
       agement.  Some often-used  commands  are  add,  print,  register,  bal-
       ancesheet and incomestatement.

       To  show a summary of commands, run hledger with no arguments.  You can
       see the same commands summary at the start of PART 4: COMMANDS below.

       To use a particular command, run hledger CMD [CMDOPTS] [CMDARGS],

       o CMD is the full command name, or its standard abbreviation  shown  in
         the commands list, or any unambiguous prefix of the name.

       o CMDOPTS  are  command-specific options, if any.  Command-specific op-
         tions must be written after the command name.  Eg: hledger print -x.

       o CMDARGS are additional  arguments  to  the  command,  if  any.   Most
         hledger  commands accept arguments representing a query, to limit the
         data in some way.  Eg: hledger reg assets:checking.

       To list a command's options, arguments, and documentation in the termi-
       nal, run hledger CMD -h.  Eg: hledger bal -h.

   Add-on commands
       In addition to the built-in commands, you can install add-on  commands:
       programs  or  scripts named "hledger-SOMETHING", which will also appear
       in hledger's commands list.  If you used  the  hledger-install  script,
       you  will  have  several  add-ons  installed already.  Some more can be
       found    in     hledger's     bin/     directory,     documented     at
       https://hledger.org/scripts.html.

       More precisely, add-on commands are programs or scripts in your shell's
       PATH, whose name starts with "hledger-" and ends with no extension or a
       recognised  extension  (".bat",  ".com",  ".exe", ".hs", ".js", ".lhs",
       ".lua", ".php", ".pl", ".py", ".rb", ".rkt", or ".sh"),  and  (on  unix
       and mac) which has executable permission for the current user.

       You can run add-on commands using hledger, much like built-in commands:
       hledger ADDONCMD [-- ADDONCMDOPTS] [ADDONCMDARGS].  But note the double
       hyphen  argument, required before add-on-specific options.  Eg: hledger
       ui -- --watch or hledger web -- --serve.  If  this  causes  difficulty,
       you  can  always  run  the  add-on  directly,  without  using  hledger:
       hledger-ui --watch or hledger-web --serve.

Options
       Run hledger -h to see general command line help.  Options can be  writ-
       ten  either  before  or after the command name.  These options are spe-
       cific to the hledger CLI:

              Flags:
                   --conf=CONFFILE        Use extra options defined in this config file. If
                                          not specified, searches upward and in XDG config
                                          dir for hledger.conf (or .hledger.conf in $HOME).
                -n --no-conf              ignore any config file

       And the following general options are common to most hledger commands:

              General input/data transformation flags:
                -f --file=[FMT:]FILE      Read data from FILE, or from stdin if FILE is -,
                                          inferring format from extension or a FMT: prefix.
                                          Can be specified more than once. If not specified,
                                          reads from $LEDGER_FILE or $HOME/.hledger.journal.
                   --rules=RULESFILE      Use rules defined in this rules file for
                                          converting subsequent CSV/SSV/TSV files. If not
                                          specified, uses FILE.csv.rules for each FILE.csv.
                   --alias=A=B|/RGX/=RPL  transform account names from A to B, or by
                                          replacing regular expression matches
                   --auto                 generate extra postings by applying auto posting
                                          rules ("=") to all transactions
                   --forecast[=PERIOD]    Generate extra transactions from periodic rules
                                          ("~"), from after the latest ordinary transaction
                                          until 6 months from now. Or, during the specified
                                          PERIOD (the equals is required). Auto posting rules
                                          will also be applied to these transactions. In
                                          hledger-ui, also make future-dated transactions
                                          visible at startup.
                -I --ignore-assertions    don't check balance assertions by default
                   --infer-costs          infer conversion equity postings from costs
                   --infer-equity         infer costs from conversion equity postings
                   --infer-market-prices  infer market prices from costs
                   --pivot=TAGNAME        use a different field or tag as account names
                -s --strict               do extra error checks (and override -I)
                   --verbose-tags         add tags indicating generated/modified data

              General output/reporting flags (supported by some commands):
                -b --begin=DATE           include postings/transactions on/after this date

                -p --period=PERIODEXP     set begin date, end date, and/or report interval,
                                          with more flexibility
                   --today=DATE           override today's date (affects relative dates)
                   --date2                match/use secondary dates instead (deprecated)
                -U --unmarked             include only unmarked postings/transactions

                                          In hledger-ui & hledger-web, do the opposite.
                   --depth=DEPTHEXP       if a number (or -NUM): show only top NUM levels
                                          of accounts. If REGEXP=NUM, only apply limiting to
                                          accounts matching the regular expression.

                   --value=WHEN[,COMM]    show amounts converted to their value on the
                                          specified date(s) in their default valuation
                                          commodity or a specified commodity. WHEN can be:
                                          'then':     value on transaction dates
                                          'end':      value at period end(s)
                                          'now':      value today
                                          YYYY-MM-DD: value on given date
                -c --commodity-style=S    Override a commodity's display style.
                                          Eg: -c '.' or -c '1.000,00 EUR'
                   --pretty[=YN]          Use box-drawing characters in text output? Can be
                                          'y'/'yes' or 'n'/'no'.
                                          If YN is specified, the equals is required.

                   --debug=[1-9]          show this much debug output (default: 1)
                   --pager=YN             use a pager when needed ? y/yes (default) or n/no
                   --color=YNA --colour   use ANSI color ? y/yes, n/no, or auto (default)

       Usually hledger accepts any unambiguous flag prefix, eg you  can  write
       --tl instead of --tldr or --dry instead of --dry-run.

       If  the  same  option appears more than once in a command line, usually
       the last (right-most) wins.  Similarly, if mutually exclusive flags are
       used together, the right-most wins.  (When flags  are  mutually  exclu-
       sive, they'll usually have a group prefix in --help.)

       With  most commands, arguments are interpreted as a hledger query which
       filter the data.  Some queries can be expressed either with options  or
       with arguments.

       Below are more tips for using the command line interface - feel free to
       skip these until you need them.

   Special characters
       Here  we touch on shell escaping/quoting rules, and give some examples.
       This is a slightly complicated topic which you may not need  at  first,
       but you should be aware of it, so you can return here when needed.

       If you are able to minimise the use of special characters in your data,
       you  won't  need  escaping as much, and your command lines will be sim-
       pler.  For example, avoiding spaces in  account  names,  and  using  an
       ISO-4217  currency  code like USD instead of the $ currency symbol, can
       be helpful.

       But if you want to use spaced account names and $, go right ahead;  es-
       caping isn't a big deal.

   Escaping shell special characters
       At  the  command  line,  characters which have special meaning for your
       shell must be "shell-escaped" (AKA "quoted") if you want hledger to see
       them.  Often these include space, <, >, (, ), |, \, $ and/or %.

       For example, to match an account name  containing  the  phrase  "credit
       card", don't write this:

              $ hledger register credit card

       In  that command, "credit" and "card" are treated as separate query ar-
       guments (described below), so this would match accounts containing  ei-
       ther word.  Instead, enclose the phrase in double or single quotes:

              $ hledger register "credit card"

       In Unix shells, writing a backslash before the character can also work.
       Eg:

              $ hledger register credit\ card

       Some  shell  characters  still  have  a  special  meaning inside double
       quotes, such as the dollar sign ($).  Eg in "assets:$account", the bash
       shell would replace $account with the value of a  shell  variable  with
       that  name.   When you don't want that, use single quotes, which escape
       more strongly:

              $ hledger balance 'assets:$account'

   Escaping on Windows
       If you are using hledger in a Powershell or Command window on Microsoft
       Windows, the escaping rules are different:

       o In a Powershell window (powershell, blue background),  you  must  use
         double quotes or single quotes (not backslash).

       o In  a  Command  window  (cmd,  black background), you must use double
         quotes (not single quotes or backslash).

       The next two sections were written for Unix-like shells, so might  need
       to be adapted if you're using cmd or powershell.  (Edits welcome.)

   Escaping regular expression special characters
       Many  hledger  arguments are regular expressions (described below), and
       these too have characters which cause special effects.  Some  of  those
       characters  are  .,  ^,  $,  [, ], (, ), |, and \.  When you don't want
       these to cause special effects, you can "regex-escape" them by  writing
       \  (a  backslash)  before them.  But since backslash is also special to
       the shell, you may need to also shell-escape the backslashes.

       Eg, in the bash shell, to match a literal $ sign, you could write:

              $ hledger balance cur:\\$

       or:

              $ hledger balance 'cur:\$'

       (The dollar sign is regex-escaped by the backslash preceding it.   Then
       that  backslash  is  shell-escaped  by  another backslash, or by single
       quotes.)

   Escaping add-on arguments
       When you run an external add-on command with hledger (described below),
       any options or arguments being passed through to the add-on  executable
       lose  one  level  of  shell-escaping, so you must add an extra level of
       shell-escaping to compensate.

       Eg, in the bash shell, to run the ui add-on and match a literal $ sign,
       you need to write:

              $ hledger ui cur:'\\$'

       or:

              $ hledger ui cur:\\\\$

       If you are wondering why four backslashes:

       o $ is unescaped

       o \$ is regex-escaped

       o \\$ is regex-escaped, then shell-escaped

       o \\\\$ is regex-escaped, then shell-escaped,  then  both  slashes  are
         shell-escaped once more for hledger argument pass-through.

       Or you can avoid such triple-escaping, by running the add-on executable
       directly:

              $ hledger-ui cur:\\$

   Escaping in other situations
       hledger  options  and arguments are sometimes used in places other than
       the command line, with different escaping rules.   For  example,  back-
       slash-quoting generally does not work there.  Here are some more tips.

       In Windows cmd      Use double quotes
       In Windows power-   Use single or double quotes
       shell
       In   hledger-ui's   Use single or double quotes
       filter prompt
       In  hledger-web's   Use single or double quotes
       search form
       In   an  argument   Don't use spaces, don't shell-escape,  do  regex-es-
       file                cape when needed
       In a config file    Use  single  or double quotes, and enclose the whole
                           argument ("desc:a b" not desc:"a b")
       In   ghci    (the   Use double quotes, and enclose the whole argument
       Haskell REPL)

   Using a wild card
       When  escaping  a special character is too much hassle (or impossible),
       you can often just write . (period) instead.  In  regular  expressions,
       this means "accept any character here".  Eg:

              $ hledger register credit.card

   Unicode characters
       hledger is expected to handle non-ascii characters correctly:

       o they  should  be  parsed  correctly in input files and on the command
         line, by all hledger tools (add, iadd, hledger-web's  search/add/edit
         forms, etc.)

       o they  should  be  displayed  correctly  by  all  hledger  tools,  and
         on-screen alignment should be preserved.

       This requires a well-configured environment.  Here are some tips:

       o A system locale must be configured, which can decode  the  characters
         being  used.  This is essential - see Text encoding and Install: Text
         encoding.

       o Your terminal software (eg  Terminal.app,  iTerm,  CMD.exe,  xterm..)
         must support unicode.  On Windows, you may need to use Windows Termi-
         nal.

       o The terminal must be using a font which includes the required unicode
         glyphs.

       o The  terminal should be configured to display wide characters as dou-
         ble width (for report alignment).

       o On Windows, for best results you should run hledger in the same  kind
         of  environment in which it was built.  Eg hledger built in the stan-
         dard CMD.EXE environment (like the binaries  on  our  download  page)
         might  show  display  problems when run in a cygwin or msys terminal,
         and vice versa.  (See eg #961).

   Regular expressions
       A regular expression (regexp) is a small piece of  text  where  certain
       characters  (like  .,  ^, $, +, *, (), |, [], \) have special meanings,
       forming a tiny language for matching text precisely -  very  useful  in
       hledger  and elsewhere.  To learn all about them, visit regular-expres-
       sions.info.

       hledger supports regexps whenever you are entering a pattern  to  match
       something,  eg  in  query  arguments,  account  aliases,  CSV if rules,
       hledger-web's search form, hledger-ui's / search, etc.  You may need to
       wrap them in quotes, especially at the command line (see Special  char-
       acters above).  Here are some examples:

       Account name queries (quoted for command line use):

              Regular expression:  Matches:
              -------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------
              bank                 assets:bank, assets:bank:savings, expenses:art:banksy, ...
              :bank                assets:bank:savings, expenses:art:banksy
              :bank:               assets:bank:savings
              '^bank'              none of those ( ^ matches beginning of text )
              'bank$'              assets:bank   ( $ matches end of text )
              'big \$ bank'        big $ bank    ( \ disables following character's special meaning )
              '\bbank\b'           assets:bank, assets:bank:savings  ( \b matches word boundaries )
              '(sav|check)ing'     saving or checking  ( (|) matches either alternative )
              'saving|checking'    saving or checking  ( outer parentheses are not needed )
              'savings?'           saving or savings   ( ? matches 0 or 1 of the preceding thing )
              'my +bank'           my bank, my  bank, ... ( + matches 1 or more of the preceding thing )
              'my *bank'           mybank, my bank, my  bank, ... ( * matches 0 or more of the preceding thing )
              'b.nk'               bank, bonk, b nk, ... ( . matches any character )

       Some other queries:

              desc:'amazon|amzn|audible'  Amazon transactions
              cur:EUR              amounts with commodity symbol containing EUR
              cur:'\$'             amounts with commodity symbol containing $
              cur:'^\$$'           only $ amounts, not eg AU$ or CA$
              cur:....?            amounts with 4-or-more-character symbols
              tag:.=202[1-3]       things with any tag whose value contains 2021, 2022 or 2023

       Account name aliases: accept . instead of : as account separator:

              alias /\./=:         replaces all periods in account names with colons

       Show multiple top-level accounts combined as one:

              --alias='/^[^:]+/=combined'  ( [^:] matches any character other than : )

       Show accounts with the second-level part removed:

              --alias '/^([^:]+):[^:]+/ = \1'
                                   match a top-level account and a second-level account
                                   and replace those with just the top-level account
                                   ( \1 in the replacement text means "whatever was matched
                                   by the first parenthesised part of the regexp"

       CSV rules: match CSV records containing dining-related MCC codes:

              if \?MCC581[124]

       Match CSV records with a specific amount around the end/start of month:

              if %amount \b3\.99
              &  %date   (29|30|31|01|02|03)$

   hledger's regular expressions
       hledger's  regular  expressions  come  from the regex-tdfa library.  If
       they're not doing what you expect, it's important to know exactly  what
       they support:

       1. they are case insensitive

       2. they  are infix matching (they do not need to match the entire thing
          being matched)

       3. they are POSIX ERE (extended regular expressions)

       4. they also support GNU word boundaries (\b, \B, \<, \>)

       5. backreferences are supported when doing text replacement in  account
          aliases  or  CSV  rules, where backreferences can be used in the re-
          placement string to reference capturing groups in the search regexp.
          Otherwise, if you write \1, it will match the digit 1.

       6. they do not support mode modifiers ((?s)),  character  classes  (\w,
          \d), or anything else not mentioned above.

       7. they  may  not  (I'm guessing not) properly support right-to-left or
          bidirectional text.

       Some things to note:

       o In the alias directive and --alias option, regular  expressions  must
         be  enclosed  in  forward  slashes  (/REGEX/).  Elsewhere in hledger,
         these are not required.

       o In queries, to match a regular expression metacharacter like $  as  a
         literal  character,  prepend  a  backslash.  Eg to search for amounts
         with the dollar sign in hledger-web, write cur:\$.

       o On the command line, some metacharacters like $ have a special  mean-
         ing to the shell and so must be escaped at least once more.  See Spe-
         cial characters.

   Argument files
       You can save a set of command line options and arguments in a file, and
       then  reuse  them by writing @FILENAME as a command line argument.  Eg:
       hledger bal @foo.args.

       An argument file's format is more restrictive than  the  command  line.
       Each line should contain just one option or argument.  Don't use spaces
       except  inside  quotes; write = or nothing between a flag and its argu-
       ment.  If you use quotes, they must enclose the whole  line.   For  the
       special  characters mentioned above, use one less level of quoting than
       you would at the command line.

   Config files
       With hledger 1.40+, you can save extra command line options  and  argu-
       ments  in  a more featureful hledger config file.  Here's a small exam-
       ple:

              # General options are listed first, and used with hledger commands that support them.
              --pretty

              # Options following a `[COMMAND]` heading are used with that hledger command only.
              [print]
              --explicit --show-costs

       To use a config file, specify it with the --conf option.   Its  options
       will  be inserted near the start of your command line, so you can over-
       ride them with command line options if needed.

       Or, you can set up an automatic config file that is used  whenever  you
       run  hledger,  by  creating  hledger.conf  in  the current directory or
       above, or .hledger.conf in your home  directory  (~/.hledger.conf),  or
       hledger.conf     in     your     XDG    config    directory    (~/.con-
       fig/hledger/hledger.conf).

       Here   is   another   example   config   you    could    start    with:
       https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/hledger.conf.sample

       You  can put not only options, but also arguments in a config file.  If
       the first word in a config file's top (general) section does not  begin
       with  a  dash (eg: print), it is treated as the command argument (over-
       riding any argument on the command line).

       On unix machines, you can add a shebang line at the  top  of  a  config
       file,  set executable permission on the file, and use it like a script.
       Eg (the -S is needed on some operating systems):

              #!/usr/bin/env -S hledger --conf

       You can ignore config files by adding the -n/--no-conf flag to the com-
       mand line.  This is useful when using hledger in scripts, or when trou-
       bleshooting.  When both --conf and  --no-conf  options  are  used,  the
       right-most wins.

       To  inspect  the  processing of config files, use --debug or --debug=8.
       Or, run the setup command, which will display any active config  files.
       (setup is not affected by config files itself, unlike other commands.)

       Warning!

       There  aren't  many  hledger  features that need a warning, but this is
       one!

       Automatic config files, while convenient, also make hledger  less  pre-
       dictable  and dependable.  It's easy to make a config file that changes
       a report's behaviour, or  breaks  your  hledger-using  scripts/applica-
       tions, in ways that will surprise you later.

       If you don't want this,

       1. Just don't create a hledger.conf file on your machine.

       2. Also  be  alert  to  downloaded  directories  which  may  contain  a
          hledger.conf file.

       3. Also if you are sharing scripts or  examples  or  support,  consider
          that others may have a hledger.conf file.

       Conversely, once you decide to use this feature, try to remember:

       1. Whenever  a  hledger command does not work as expected, try it again
          with -n (--no-conf) to see if a config file was to blame.

       2. Whenever you call hledger from a script, consider whether that  call
          should use -n or not.

       3. Be  conservative about what you put in your config file; try to con-
          sider the effect on all your reports.

       4. To troubleshoot the effect of config  files,  run  with  --debug  or
          --debug 8.

       The config file feature was added in hledger 1.40 and is considered ex-
       perimental.

   Shell completions
       If  you  use  the  bash  or  zsh shells, you can optionally set up con-
       text-sensitive autocompletion for hledger command lines.  Try  pressing
       hledger<SPACE><TAB><TAB>  (should list all hledger commands) or hledger
       reg acct:<TAB><TAB> (should list your  top-level  account  names).   If
       completions  aren't  working,  or for more details, see Install > Shell
       completions.

Output
   Output destination
       hledger commands send their output to the terminal by default.  You can
       of course redirect this, eg into a file, using standard shell syntax:

              $ hledger print > foo.txt

       Some commands (print, register, stats, the balance commands) also  pro-
       vide  the  -o/--output-file  option,  which does the same thing without
       needing the shell.  Eg:

              $ hledger print -o foo.txt
              $ hledger print -o -        # write to stdout (the default)

   Output format
       Some commands offer other kinds of output, not just text on the  termi-
       nal.  Here are those commands and the formats currently supported:

       command                 txt     html     csv/tsv     fods     beancount      sql     json
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       aregister               Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y
       balance                 Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y
       balancesheet            Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y
       balancesheetequity      Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y
       cashflow                Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y
       incomestatement         Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y
       print                   Y       Y        Y           Y        Y              Y       Y
       register                Y       Y        Y           Y                               Y

       You  can  also  see  which output formats a command supports by running
       hledger CMD -h and looking for the -O/--output-format=FMT option,

       You can select the output format by using that option:

              $ hledger print -O csv    # print CSV to standard output

       or by  choosing  a  suitable  filename  extension  with  the  -o/--out-
       put-file=FILE.FMT option:

              $ hledger balancesheet -o foo.csv    # write CSV to foo.csv

       The -O option can be combined with -o to override the file extension if
       needed:

              $ hledger balancesheet -o foo.txt -O csv    # write CSV to foo.txt

       Here are some notes about the various output formats.

   Text output
       This is the default: human readable, plain text report output, suitable
       for viewing with a monospace font in a terminal.  If your data contains
       unicode or wide characters, you'll need a terminal and font that render
       those correctly.  (This can be challenging on MS Windows.)

       Some  reports  (register,  aregister) will normally use the full window
       width.  If this isn't working or you want to override it, you  can  use
       the -w/--width option.

       Balance  reports (balance, balancesheet, incomestatement...)  use what-
       ever width they need.  Multi-period multi-currency reports can often be
       wider than the window.  Besides using a pager, helpful  techniques  for
       this  situation  include  --layout=bare, -V, cur:, --transpose, --tree,
       --depth, --drop, switching to html output, etc.

   Box-drawing characters
       hledger draws simple table borders by default, to minimise the risk  of
       display  problems  caused by a terminal/font not supporting box-drawing
       characters.

       But your terminal and font probably do support them,  so  we  recommend
       using  the --pretty flag to show prettier tables in the terminal.  This
       is a good flag to add to your hledger config file.

   Colour
       hledger tries to automatically detect ANSI colour and text styling sup-
       port and use it when appropriate.  (Currently, it is used rather  mini-
       mally:  some reports show negative numbers in red, and help output uses
       bold text for emphasis.)

       You can override this by setting the NO_COLOR environment  variable  to
       disable  it,  or  by using the --color/--colour option, perhaps in your
       config file, with a y/yes or n/no value to force it on or off.

   Paging
       In unix-like environments, when displaying large output (in any  output
       format) in the terminal, hledger tries to use a pager when appropriate.
       (You  can disable this with the --pager=no option, perhaps in your con-
       fig file.)

       The pager shows one page of text at a time, and lets you scroll  around
       to  see more.  While it is active, usually SPACE shows the next page, h
       shows help, and q quits.  The home/end/page up/page  down/cursor  keys,
       and mouse scrolling, may also work.

       hledger will use the pager specified by the PAGER environment variable,
       otherwise  less  if  available, otherwise more if available.  (With one
       exception: hledger help -p TOPIC will always use less, so that  it  can
       scroll to the topic.)

       The  pager  is  expected  to  display  hledger's  ANSI  colour and text
       styling.  If you see junk characters, you might need to configure  your
       pager  to  handle ANSI codes.  Or you could disable colour as described
       above.

       If you are using the less pager, hledger automatically appends a number
       of options to the LESS variable to enable ANSI colour and a  number  of
       other   conveniences.   (At  the  time  of  writing:  --chop-long-lines
       --hilite-unread   --ignore-case   --mouse    --no-init    --quit-at-eof
       --quit-if-one-screen            --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS           --shift=8
       --squeeze-blank-lines --use-backslash ).  If these don't work well, you
       can set your preferred options in the HLEDGER_LESS variable, which will
       be used instead.

   HTML output
       HTML output can be styled by an optional hledger.css file in  the  same
       directory.

       HTML  output  will  be  a  HTML fragment, not a complete HTML document.
       Like other hledger output, for non-ascii characters  it  will  use  the
       system locale's text encoding (see Text encoding).

   CSV / TSV output
       In  CSV or TSV output, digit group marks (such as thousands separators)
       are disabled automatically.

   FODS output
       FODS is the OpenDocument Spreadsheet format as plain XML,  as  accepted
       by  LibreOffice  and OpenOffice.  If you use their spreadsheet applica-
       tions, this is better than CSV because it works across locales (decimal
       point vs.  decimal comma, character encoding stored in XML header, thus
       no problems with umlauts), it supports fixed header rows  and  columns,
       cell  types  (string  vs.   number vs.  date), separation of number and
       currency (currency is displayed but the cell type is still a number ac-
       cessible for computation), styles (bold), borders.  Btw.  you can still
       extract CSV from FODS/ODS  using  various  utilities  like  libreoffice
       --headless or ods2csv.

   Beancount output
       This  is  Beancount's  journal format.  You can use this to export your
       hledger data to Beancount, eg to use the Fava web app.

       hledger will try to adjust your data to suit Beancount,  automatically.
       Be  cautious  and  check  the  conversion until you are confident it is
       good.  If you plan to export to Beancount often, you may want to follow
       its conventions, for a cleaner conversion:

       o use Beancount-friendly account names

       o use currency codes instead of currency symbols

       o use cost notation instead of equity conversion postings

       o avoid virtual postings, balance assignments, and secondary dates.

       There is one big adjustment you must handle  yourself:  for  Beancount,
       the  top  level  account names must be Assets, Liabilities, Equity, In-
       come, and/or Expenses.  You can use account aliases to rewrite your ac-
       count names temporarily, if needed, as in  this  hledger2beancount.conf
       config file.

       2024-12-20: Some more things not yet handled for you:

       o P  directives  are  not converted automatically - convert those your-
         self.

       o Balance assignments are  not  converted  (Beancount  doesn't  support
         them) - replace those with explicit amounts.

   Beancount account names
       Aside  from the top-level names, hledger will adjust your account names
       to make valid Beancount account names, by capitalising each  part,  re-
       placing  spaces  with  -,  replacing  other unsupported characters with
       C<HEXBYTES>, prepending A to account name parts which don't begin  with
       a  letter  or  digit, and appending :A to account names which have only
       one part.

   Beancount commodity names
       hledger will adjust your commodity names to make valid  Beancount  com-
       modity/currency names, which must be 2-24 uppercase letters, digits, or
       ',  ., _, -, beginning with a letter and ending with a letter or digit.
       hledger will convert known currency symbols to ISO 4217 currency codes,
       capitalise letters, replace spaces with -,  replace  other  unsupported
       characters with C<HEXBYTES>, and prepend or append C if needed.

   Beancount virtual postings
       Beancount doesn't allow virtual postings; if you have any, they will be
       omitted from beancount output.

   Beancount metadata
       hledger  tags  will be converted to Beancount metadata (except for tags
       whose name begins with _).  Metadata names will be adjusted to be Bean-
       count-compatible: beginning with a lowercase letter, at least two char-
       acters long, and with unsupported characters encoded.  Metadata  values
       will use Beancount's string type.

       In  hledger,  objects can have the same tag repeated with multiple val-
       ues.   Eg  an  assets:cash  account  might  have  both  type:Asset  and
       type:Cash  tags.   For  Beancount these will be combined into one, with
       the values combined, comma separated.  Eg: type: "Asset, Cash".

   Beancount costs
       Beancount doesn't allow redundant  costs  and  conversion  postings  as
       hledger  does.   If you have any of these, the conversion postings will
       be omitted.  Currently we support at most one cost +  conversion  post-
       ings group per transaction.

   Beancount operating currency
       Declaring  an  operating  currency  (or several) improves Beancount and
       Fava reports.  Currently hledger will declare  each  currency  used  in
       cost  amounts  as an operating currency.  If needed, replace these with
       your own declaration, like

              option "operating_currency" "USD"

   SQL output
       SQL output is expected to work at least with SQLite,  MySQL  and  Post-
       gres.

       The  SQL  statements are expected to be executed in the empty database.
       If you already have tables created via SQL output of hledger, you would
       probably want to either clear data from these (via delete  or  truncate
       SQL  statements) or drop the tables completely before import; otherwise
       your postings would be duplicated.

       For SQLite, it is more useful if you modify the generated id  field  to
       be a PRIMARY KEY.  Eg:

              $ hledger print -O sql | sed 's/id serial/id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL/g' | ...

       This is not yet much used; feedback is welcome.

   JSON output
       Our  JSON is rather large and verbose, since it is a faithful represen-
       tation of hledger's internal data types.  To understand its  structure,
       read    the   Haskell   type   definitions,   which   are   mostly   in
       https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/mas-
       ter/hledger-lib/Hledger/Data/Types.hs.  hledger-web's OpenAPI  specifi-
       cation may also be relevant.

       hledger  stores  numbers  with  sometimes up to 255 significant digits.
       This is too many digits for most JSON consumers, so in JSON  output  we
       round numbers to at most 10 decimal places.  (We don't limit the number
       of  integer  digits.)  If you find this causing problems, please let us
       know.  Related: #1195

       This is not yet much used; feedback is welcome.

   Commodity styles
       When displaying amounts, hledger infers a standard  display  style  for
       each commodity/currency, as described below in Commodity display style.

       If needed, this can be overridden by a -c/--commodity-style option (ex-
       cept for cost amounts and amounts displayed by the print command, which
       are  always  displayed with all decimal digits).  For example, the fol-
       lowing will force dollar amounts to be displayed as shown:

              $ hledger print -c '$1.000,0'

       This option can be repeated to set the display style for multiple  com-
       modities/currencies.  Its argument is as described in the commodity di-
       rective.

       In  some  cases  hledger will adjust number formatting to improve their
       parseability (such as adding trailing decimal marks when needed).

   Debug output
       We intend hledger to be relatively easy to troubleshoot, introspect and
       develop.  You can add --debug[=N] to any hledger command  line  to  see
       additional  debug  output.  N ranges from 1 (least output, the default)
       to 9 (maximum output).  Typically you would start with 1  and  increase
       until  you  are seeing enough.  Debug output goes to stderr, and is not
       affected by -o/--output-file (unless you redirect stderr to stdout, eg:
       2>&1).  It will be interleaved with normal output, which can  help  re-
       veal  when parts of the code are evaluated.  To capture debug output in
       a log file instead, you can usually redirect stderr, eg:

              hledger bal --debug=3 2>hledger.log

       (This option doesn't work in a config file yet.)

Environment
       These environment variables affect hledger:

       HLEDGER_LESS If less is your pager, this variable  specifies  the  less
       options  hledger  should  use.   (Otherwise,  LESS + custom options are
       used.)

       LEDGER_FILE The main journal  file  to  use  when  not  specified  with
       -f/--file.  Default: $HOME/.hledger.journal.

       NO_COLOR If this environment variable exists (with any value, including
       empty),  hledger  will not use ANSI color codes in terminal output, un-
       less overridden by an explicit --color=y or --colour=y option.

PART 2: DATA FORMATS
Journal
       hledger's usual data source is a plain text file containing journal en-
       tries in hledger journal format.  If you're looking for a quick  refer-
       ence,  jump  ahead  to the journal cheatsheet (or use the table of con-
       tents at https://hledger.org/hledger.html).

       This file represents an accounting General Journal.  The .journal  file
       extension  is most often used, though not strictly required.  The jour-
       nal file contains a number of transaction entries,  each  describing  a
       transfer  of  money  (or  any  commodity) between two or more named ac-
       counts, in a simple format readable by both hledger and humans.

       hledger's journal format is compatible with most  of  Ledger's  journal
       format, but not all of it.  The differences and interoperation tips are
       described  at  hledger and Ledger.  With some care, and by avoiding in-
       compatible features, you can keep  your  hledger  journal  readable  by
       Ledger  and vice versa.  This can useful eg for comparing the behaviour
       of one app against the other.

       You can use hledger without learning any more about this file; just use
       the add or web or import commands to create and update it.

       Many users, though, edit the journal file with a text editor, and track
       changes with a version control system such as git.  Editor add-ons such
       as ledger-mode or hledger-mode  for  Emacs,  vim-ledger  for  Vim,  and
       hledger-vscode for Visual Studio Code, make this easier, adding colour,
       formatting, tab completion, and useful commands.  See Editor configura-
       tion at hledger.org for the full list.

       A hledger journal file can contain three kinds of thing: comment lines,
       transactions,  and/or  directives (including periodic transaction rules
       and auto posting rules).  Understanding the journal  file  format  will
       also  give  you a good understanding of hledger's data model.  Here's a
       quick cheatsheet/overview, followed by detailed  descriptions  of  each
       part.

   Comments
       Lines in the journal will be ignored if they begin with a hash (#) or a
       semicolon  (;).  (See also Other syntax.)  hledger will also ignore re-
       gions beginning with a comment line and ending with an end comment line
       (or file end).  Here's a suggestion for choosing between them:

       o # for top-level notes

       o ; for commenting out things temporarily

       o comment for quickly commenting large regions (remember it's there, or
         you might get confused)

       Eg:

              # a comment line
              ; another commentline
              comment
              A multi-line comment block,
              continuing until "end comment" directive
              or the end of the current file.
              end comment

       Some hledger entries can have same-line comments attached to them, from
       ; (semicolon) to end of line.  See Transaction comments,  Posting  com-
       ments, and Account comments below.

   Transactions
       Transactions  are the main unit of information in a journal file.  They
       represent events, typically a movement of some quantity of  commodities
       between two or more named accounts.

       Each  transaction is recorded as a journal entry, beginning with a sim-
       ple date in column 0.  This can be followed by any of the following op-
       tional fields, separated by spaces:

       o a status character (empty, !, or *)

       o a code (any short number or text, enclosed in parentheses)

       o a description (any remaining text until end of line or a semicolon)

       o a comment (any remaining text following  a  semicolon  until  end  of
         line, and any following indented lines beginning with a semicolon)

       o 0 or more indented posting lines, describing what was transferred and
         the  accounts  involved (indented comment lines are also allowed, but
         not blank lines or non-indented lines).

       Here's a simple journal file containing one transaction:

              2008/01/01 income
                assets:bank:checking   $1
                income:salary         $-1

   Dates
   Simple dates
       Dates in the journal  file  use  simple  dates  format:  YYYY-MM-DD  or
       YYYY/MM/DD or YYYY.MM.DD, with leading zeros optional.  The year may be
       omitted,  in  which case it will be inferred from the context: the cur-
       rent transaction, the default year set with a Y directive, or the  cur-
       rent  date  when  the  command  is  run.   Some  examples:  2010-01-31,
       2010/01/31, 2010.1.31, 1/31.

       (The UI also accepts simple dates, as well as the more  flexible  smart
       dates documented in the hledger manual.)

   Posting dates
       You  can  give  individual  postings a different date from their parent
       transaction, by adding a posting comment containing a tag  (see  below)
       like date:DATE.  This is probably the best way to control posting dates
       precisely.   Eg  in  this  example the expense should appear in May re-
       ports, and the deduction from checking should be reported  on  6/1  for
       easy bank reconciliation:

              2015/5/30
                  expenses:food     $10  ; food purchased on saturday 5/30
                  assets:checking        ; bank cleared it on monday, date:6/1

              $ hledger -f t.j register food
              2015-05-30                      expenses:food                  $10           $10

              $ hledger -f t.j register checking
              2015-06-01                      assets:checking               $-10          $-10

       DATE  should be a simple date; if the year is not specified it will use
       the year of the transaction's date.
       The date: tag must have a valid simple date value if it is present,  eg
       a date: tag with no value is not allowed.

   Status
       Transactions  (or  individual postings within a transaction) can have a
       status mark, which is a single character  before  the  transaction  de-
       scription  (or posting account name), separated from it by a space, in-
       dicating one of three statuses:

       mark     status
       ------------------
                unmarked
       !        pending
       *        cleared

       When reporting, you  can  filter  by  status  with  the  -U/--unmarked,
       -P/--pending, and -C/--cleared flags (and you can combine these, eg -UP
       to  match all except cleared things).  Or you can use the status:, sta-
       tus:!, and status:* queries, or the U, P, C keys in hledger-ui.

       (Note: in Ledger the "unmarked" state is called "uncleared"; in hledger
       we renamed it to "unmarked" for semantic clarity.)

       Status marks are optional, but can be helpful eg for  reconciling  with
       real-world accounts.  Some editor modes provide highlighting and short-
       cuts  for working with status.  Eg in Emacs ledger-mode, you can toggle
       transaction status with C-c C-e, or posting status with C-c C-c.

       What "uncleared", "pending", and "cleared" actually mean is up to  you.
       Here's one suggestion:

       status       meaning
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------
       uncleared    recorded but not yet reconciled; needs review
       pending      tentatively reconciled (if needed, eg during a big reconcil-
                    iation)
       cleared      complete, reconciled as far as possible, and considered cor-
                    rect

       With  this scheme, you would use -PC to see the current balance at your
       bank, -U to see things which will probably hit your bank soon (like un-
       cashed checks), and no flags to see the most up-to-date state  of  your
       finances.

   Code
       After  the  status mark, but before the description, you can optionally
       write a transaction "code", enclosed in parentheses.  This  is  a  good
       place  to record a check number, or some other important transaction id
       or reference number.

   Description
       After the date, status mark and/or code fields, the rest  of  the  line
       (or  until a comment is begun with ;) is the transaction's description.
       Here you can describe the transaction (called the "narration" in tradi-
       tional bookkeeping), or you can record a payee/payer name, or  you  can
       leave it empty.

       Transaction  descriptions  show  up in print output and in register re-
       ports, and can be listed with the descriptions command.

       You can query by description with desc:DESCREGEX, or pivot on  descrip-
       tion with --pivot desc.

   Payee and note
       Sometimes people want a dedicated payee/payer field that can be queried
       and  checked more strictly.  If you want that, you can write a | (pipe)
       character in the description.  This divides it into a "payee" field  on
       the left, and a "note" field on the right.  (Either can be empty.)

       You  can  query  these  with  payee:PAYEEREGEX and note:NOTEREGEX, list
       their values with the payees and notes commands, or pivot on  payee  or
       note.

       Note: in transactions with no | character, description, payee, and note
       all have the same value.  Once a | is added, they become distinct.  (If
       you'd  like  to  change  this  behaviour, please propose it on the mail
       list.)

       If you want more strict error checking, you can declare the valid payee
       names with payee directives, and then enforce these with hledger  check
       payees.   (Note:  because  of the above, for this you'll need to ensure
       every transaction description contains a | and  therefore  a  checkable
       payee name, even if it's empty.)

   Transaction comments
       Text  following  ;, after a transaction description, and/or on indented
       lines immediately below it, form comments for that  transaction.   They
       are  reproduced by print but otherwise ignored, except they may contain
       tags, which are not ignored.

              2012-01-01 something  ; a transaction comment
                  ; a second line of transaction comment
                  expenses   1
                  assets

   Postings
       A posting is an addition of some amount to, or removal of  some  amount
       from,  an account.  Each posting line begins with at least one space or
       tab (2 or 4 spaces is common), followed by:

       o (optional) a status character (empty, !, or *), followed by a space

       o (required) an account name (any text,  optionally  containing  single
         spaces, until end of line or a double space)

       o (optional) two or more spaces (or tabs) followed by an amount.

       If  the  amount is positive, it is being added to the account; if nega-
       tive, it is being removed from the account.

       The posting amounts in a transaction must sum up  to  zero,  indicating
       that  the  inflows  and  outflows  are  equal.  We call this a balanced
       transaction.  (You can read more about the nitty-gritty details of "sum
       up to zero" in Transaction balancing below.)

       As a convenience, you can optionally leave one  amount  blank;  hledger
       will infer what it should be so as to balance the transaction.

   Debits and credits
       The traditional accounting concepts of debit and credit of course exist
       in  hledger,  but  we  represent  them  with numeric sign, as described
       above.  Positive and negative  posting  amounts  represent  debits  and
       credits respectively.

       You  don't  need  to  remember  that, but if you would like to - eg for
       helping newcomers or for talking with your accountant - here's a  handy
       mnemonic:

       debit  / plus  / left  / short  words
       credit / minus / right / longer words

   The two space delimiter
       Be  sure  to  notice the unusual separator between the account name and
       the following amount.  Because hledger allows account names with spaces
       in them, you must separate the account name and amount (if any) by  two
       or  more  spaces (or tabs).  It's easy to forget at first.  If you ever
       see the amount being treated as part of the account name,  you'll  know
       you probably need to add another space between them.

   Account names
       Accounts  are  the  main  way of categorising things in hledger.  As in
       Double Entry Bookkeeping, they can represent real world accounts  (such
       as a bank account), or more abstract categories such as "money borrowed
       from Frank" or "money spent on electricity".

       You  can  use any account names you like, but we usually start with the
       traditional accounting categories, which in english are assets, liabil-
       ities, equity, revenues, expenses.  (You might see these referred to as
       A, L, E, R, X for short.)

       For more precise reporting, we usually divide the  top  level  accounts
       into more detailed subaccounts, by writing a full colon between account
       name  parts.   For example, from the account names assets:bank:checking
       and expenses:food, hledger will infer this hierarchy of five accounts:

              assets
              assets:bank
              assets:bank:checking
              expenses
              expenses:food

       Shown as an outline, the hierarchical tree structure is more clear:

              assets
               bank
                checking
              expenses
               food

       hledger reports can summarise the account tree to any depth, so you can
       go as deep as you like with subcategories,  but  keeping  your  account
       names relatively simple may be best when starting out.

       Account names may be capitalised or not; they may contain letters, num-
       bers,  symbols,  or  single  spaces.  Note, when an account name and an
       amount are written on the same line, they must be separated by  two  or
       more spaces (or tabs).

       Parentheses  or  brackets enclosing the full account name indicate vir-
       tual postings, described below.  Parentheses or  brackets  internal  to
       the account name have no special meaning.

       Account  names  can  be  altered  temporarily or permanently by account
       aliases.

   Amounts
       After the account name, there is usually an amount.  (Remember: between
       account name and amount, there must be two or more spaces.)

       hledger's amount format is flexible, supporting  several  international
       formats.   Here  are  some examples.  Amounts have a number (the "quan-
       tity"):

              1

       ..and usually a currency symbol or commodity name (more on this below),
       to the left or right of the quantity,  with  or  without  a  separating
       space:

              $1
              4000 AAPL
              3 "green apples"

       Amounts can be preceded by a minus sign (or a plus sign, though plus is
       the  default), The sign can be written before or after a left-side com-
       modity symbol:

              -$1
              $-1

       One or more spaces between the sign and the number are acceptable  when
       parsing (but they won't be displayed in output):

              + $1
              $-      1

       Scientific E notation is allowed:

              1E-6
              EUR 1E3

   Decimal marks
       A decimal mark can be written as a period or a comma:

              1.23
              1,23

       Both of these are common in international number formats, so hledger is
       not  biased  towards  one  or the other.  Because hledger also supports
       digit group marks (eg thousands separators), this means that  a  number
       like  1,000  or 1.000 containing just one period or comma is ambiguous.
       In such cases, hledger by default assumes it is  a  decimal  mark,  and
       will parse both of those as 1.

       To  help  hledger  parse such ambiguous numbers more accurately, if you
       use digit group marks, we recommend declaring the decimal mark  explic-
       itly.   The  best  way is to add a decimal-mark directive at the top of
       each data file, like this:

              decimal-mark .

       Or you can declare it per  commodity  with  commodity  directives,  de-
       scribed below.

       hledger  also accepts numbers like 10. with no digits after the decimal
       mark (and will sometimes display numbers that way to disambiguate  them
       - see Trailing decimal marks).

   Digit group marks
       In  the integer part of the amount quantity (left of the decimal mark),
       groups of digits can optionally be separated by a digit group mark -  a
       comma  or  period  (whichever  is not used as decimal mark), or a space
       (several Unicode space variants, like  no-break  space,  are  also  ac-
       cepted).   So these are all valid amounts in a journal file:

                   $1,000,000.00
                EUR 2.000.000,00
              INR 9,99,99,999.00
                    1 000 000.00   ; <- ordinary space
                    1 000 000.00   ; <- no-break space

   Commodity
       Amounts  in  hledger  have both a "quantity", which is a signed decimal
       number, and a "commodity", which is a currency symbol, stock ticker, or
       any word or phrase describing something you are tracking.

       If the commodity name contains non-letters (spaces, numbers, or punctu-
       ation), you must always write it inside double quotes ("green  apples",
       "ABC123").

       If  you  write just a bare number, that too will have a commodity, with
       name ""; we call that the "no-symbol commodity".

       Actually, hledger combines these  single-commodity  amounts  into  more
       powerful  multi-commodity amounts, which are what it works with most of
       the time.  A multi-commodity amount could be, eg: 1 USD, 2  EUR,  3.456
       TSLA.   In  practice,  you  will  only  see  multi-commodity amounts in
       hledger's output; you can't write them directly in the journal file.

       By default, the format of amounts in the journal influences how hledger
       displays them in output.  This is explained in Commodity display  style
       below.

   Costs
       After  a posting amount, you can note its cost (when buying) or selling
       price (when selling) in another commodity, by writing  either  @  UNIT-
       PRICE  or @@ TOTALPRICE after it.  This indicates a conversion transac-
       tion, where one commodity is exchanged for another.

       (You might also see this called "transaction price"  in  hledger  docs,
       discussions,  or code; that term was directionally neutral and reminded
       that it is a price specific to a transaction, but we now just  call  it
       "cost", with the understanding that the transaction could be a purchase
       or a sale.)

       Costs  are usually written explicitly with @ or @@, but can also be in-
       ferred automatically for simple multi-commodity transactions.  Note, if
       costs are inferred, the order of postings  is  significant;  the  first
       posting will have a cost attached, in the commodity of the second.

       As  an  example, here are several ways to record purchases of a foreign
       currency in hledger, using the cost notation either explicitly  or  im-
       plicitly:

       1. Write the price per unit, as @ UNITPRICE after the amount:

                  2009/1/1
                    assets:euros     100 @ $1.35  ; one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
                    assets:dollars                 ; balancing amount is -$135.00

       2. Write the total price, as @@ TOTALPRICE after the amount:

                  2009/1/1
                    assets:euros     100 @@ $135  ; one hundred euros purchased at $135 for the lot
                    assets:dollars

       3. Specify amounts for all postings, using exactly two commodities, and
          let hledger infer the price that balances the transaction.  Note the
          effect of posting order: the price is added to first posting, making
          it 100 @@ $135, as in example 2:

                  2009/1/1
                    assets:euros     100          ; one hundred euros purchased
                    assets:dollars  $-135          ; for $135

       Amounts  can  be  converted  to cost at report time using the -B/--cost
       flag; this is discussed more in the Cost reporting section.

       Note that the cost normally should be a positive  amount,  though  it's
       not  required to be.  This can be a little confusing, see discussion at
       --infer-market-prices: market prices from transactions.

   Balance assertions
       hledger supports Ledger-style  balance  assertions  in  journal  files.
       These  look  like, for example, = EXPECTEDBALANCE following a posting's
       amount.  Eg here we assert the expected dollar balance  in  accounts  a
       and b after each posting:

              2013/1/1
                a   $1 =  $1
                b      = $-1

              2013/1/2
                a   $1 =  $2
                b  $-1 = $-2

       After reading a journal file, hledger will check all balance assertions
       and  report  an error if any of them fail.  Balance assertions can pro-
       tect you from, eg, inadvertently disrupting reconciled  balances  while
       cleaning  up  old  entries.   You can disable them temporarily with the
       -I/--ignore-assertions flag, which can be useful for troubleshooting or
       for reading Ledger files.  (Note: this flag currently does not  disable
       balance assignments, described below).

   Assertions and ordering
       hledger  calculates  and checks an account's balance assertions in date
       order (and when there are multiple assertions on the same day, in parse
       order).  Note this is different from Ledger,  which  checks  assertions
       always in parse order, ignoring dates.

       This means in hledger you can freely reorder transactions, postings, or
       files, and balance assertions will usually keep working.  The exception
       is  when you reorder multiple postings on the same day, to the same ac-
       count, which have balance assertions; those will likely need updating.

   Assertions and multiple files
       If an account has transactions appearing in multiple files, balance as-
       sertions can still work - but only if those files are part of a hierar-
       chy made by include directives.

       If the same files are specified with two  -f  options  on  the  command
       line,  the  assertions in the second will not see the balances from the
       first.

       To work around this, arrange your files in a  hierarchy  with  include.
       Or,  you could concatenate the files temporarily, and process them like
       one big file.

       Why does it work this way ?  It might be related to hledger's  goal  of
       stable  predictable reports.  File hierarchy is considered "permanent",
       part of your data, while the order of command line options/arguments is
       not.  We don't want transient changes to be able to change the  meaning
       of  the  data.  Eg it would be frustrating if tomorrow all your balance
       assertions broke because you wrote command line arguments in a  differ-
       ent order.  (Discussion welcome.)

   Assertions and costs
       Balance assertions ignore costs, and should normally be written without
       one:

              2019/1/1
                (a)     $1 @ 1 = $1

       We  do allow costs to be written in balance assertion amounts, however,
       and print shows them, but  they  don't  affect  whether  the  assertion
       passes  or  fails.  This is for backward compatibility (hledger's close
       command used to generate balance assertions with  costs),  and  because
       balance assignments do use costs (see below).

   Assertions and commodities
       The  balance  assertions described so far are "single commodity balance
       assertions": they assert and check the balance in one commodity, ignor-
       ing any others that may be present.  This  is  how  balance  assertions
       work in Ledger also.

       If  an account contains multiple commodities, you can assert their bal-
       ances by writing multiple postings with  balance  assertions,  one  for
       each commodity:

              2013/1/1
                usd   $-1
                eur   -1
                both

              2013/1/2
                both    0 = $1
                both    0 = 1

       In  hledger  you can make a stronger "sole commodity balance assertion"
       by writing two equals signs (== EXPECTEDBALANCE).   This  also  asserts
       that there are no other commodities in the account besides the asserted
       one (or at least, that their current balance is zero):

              2013/1/1
                usd   $-1  == $-1  ; these sole commodity assertions succeed
                eur   -1  == -1
                both      ;==  $1  ; this one would fail because 'both' contains $ and

       It's less easy to make a "sole commodities balance assertion" (note the
       plural)  - ie, asserting that an account contains two or more specified
       commodities and no others.  It can be done by

       1. isolating each commodity in a subaccount, and asserting those

       2. and also asserting there are no commodities in  the  parent  account
          itself:

          2013/1/1
            usd       $-1
            eur       -1
            both        0 == 0   ; nothing up my sleeve
            both:usd   $1 == $1  ; a dollar here
            both:eur   1 == 1  ; a euro there

   Assertions and subaccounts
       All of the balance assertions above (both = and ==) are "subaccount-ex-
       clusive  balance  assertions";  they  ignore any balances that exist in
       deeper subaccounts.

       In hledger you can make "subaccount-inclusive  balance  assertions"  by
       adding a star after the equals (=* or ==*):

              2019/1/1
                equity:start
                assets:checking  $10
                assets:savings   $10
                assets            $0 ==* $20  ; assets + subaccounts contains $20 and nothing else

   Assertions and status
       Balance  assertions always consider postings of all statuses (unmarked,
       pending, or cleared); they are not  affected  by  the  -U/--unmarked  /
       -P/--pending / -C/--cleared flags or the status: query.

   Assertions and virtual postings
       Balance assertions always consider both real and virtual postings; they
       are not affected by the --real/-R flag or real: query.

   Assertions and auto postings
       Balance  assertions  are  affected  by the --auto flag, which generates
       auto postings, which can alter account balances.  Because auto postings
       are optional in hledger, accounts affected by them effectively have two
       balances.  But balance assertions can only test one  or  the  other  of
       these.  So to avoid making fragile assertions, either:

       o assert the balance calculated with --auto, and always use --auto with
         that file

       o or assert the balance calculated without --auto, and never use --auto
         with that file

       o or avoid balance assertions on accounts affected by auto postings (or
         avoid auto postings entirely).

   Assertions and precision
       Balance  assertions  compare  the exactly calculated amounts, which are
       not always what is shown by reports.   Eg  a  commodity  directive  may
       limit  the  display  precision, but this will not affect balance asser-
       tions.  Balance assertion failure messages show exact amounts.

   Assertions and hledger add
       Balance assertions can be included in the amounts given  in  add.   All
       types  of  assertions are supported, and assertions can be used as in a
       normal journal file.

       All transactions, not just those that have an explicit  assertion,  are
       validated  against  the existing assertions in the journal.  This means
       it is possible for an added transaction to fail even if its  assertions
       are correct as of the transaction date.

       If this assertion checking is not desired, then it can be disabled with
       -I.

       However, balance assignments are currently not supported.

   Posting comments
       Text  following  ;,  at  the  end of a posting line, and/or on indented
       lines immediately below it, form comments for that posting.   They  are
       reproduced  by  print  but  otherwise  ignored, except they may contain
       tags, which are not ignored.

              2012-01-01
                  expenses   1  ; a comment for posting 1
                  assets
                  ; a comment for posting 2
                  ; a second comment line for posting 2

   Transaction balancing
       How exactly does hledger decide when a transaction is balanced  ?   The
       general goal is that if you look at the journal entry and calculate the
       amounts' sum perfectly with pencil and paper, hledger should agree with
       you.

       Real  world  transactions,  especially for investments or cryptocurren-
       cies, often involve imprecise costs,  complex  decimals,  and/or  infi-
       nitely-recurring  decimals, which are difficult or inconvenient to han-
       dle on a computer.  So to be a practical accounting system, hledger al-
       lows some imprecision  when  checking  transaction  balancedness.   The
       question is, how much imprecision should be allowed ?

       hledger  currently decides it based on the commodity display styles: if
       the postings' sum would appear to be zero when displayed with the stan-
       dard display precisions, the transaction is considered balanced.

       Or equivalently: if the journal entry is displayed with amounts rounded
       to the standard display precisions (with hledger  print  --round=hard),
       and  a  human  with  pencil  and paper would agree that those displayed
       amounts add up to zero, the transaction is considered balanced.

       This  has  some  advantages:  it  is  fairly  intuitive,  general   not
       hard-coded,  yet  configurable  when  needed.  On the downside it means
       that transaction balancedness is related to  commodity  display  preci-
       sions,  so  eg  when  using -c/--commodity-style to display things with
       more than usual precision, you might need to fix some of  your  journal
       entries (ie, add decimal digits to make them balance more precisely).

       Other PTA tools (Ledger, Beancount..)  have their own ways of doing it.
       Possible improvements are discussed at #1964.

       Note:  if you have multiple journal files, and are relying on commodity
       directives to make imprecise journal entries balance,  the  directives'
       placement might be important - see commodity directive.

   Tags
       Tags  are  a  way  to  add extra labels or data fields to transactions,
       postings, or accounts.  They are usually a word or hyphenated word, im-
       mediately followed by a full colon, written within  the  comment  of  a
       transaction, a posting, or an account directive.  (Yes, storing data in
       comments is slightly weird!)

       You can write each tag on its own comment line, or multiple tags on one
       line,  separated  by  commas.  Tags can also have a value, which is any
       text after the colon until the next comma or  end  of  line,  excluding
       surrounding whitespace.  (hledger tag values can't contain commas.)  If
       the  same tag name appears multiple times in a comment, each name:value
       pair is preserved.

       An example: in this journal there are six tags,  one  of  them  with  a
       value:

              account assets:checking         ; accounttag:
              account expenses:food

              2017/1/16 bought groceries      ; transactiontag:
                  ; transactiontag2:
                  assets:checking        $-1
                   ; posting-tag-1:, (belongs to the posting above)
                  expenses:food           $1  ; posting-tag-2:, posting-tag-3: with a value

   Querying with tags
       Tags  are  most  often  used  to select a subset of data; you can match
       tagged things by tag name and or tag value with  a  tag:  query.   (See
       queries below.)

       When  querying for tag names or values, note that postings inherit tags
       from their transaction and from their account, and transactions acquire
       tags from their postings.  So in the example above, - the assets:check-
       ing posting effectively has four tags (one of its own, one from the ac-
       count, two from the transaction) -  the  expenses:food  posting  effec-
       tively  has  four tags (two of its own, two from the transaction) - the
       transaction effectively has all six tags (two of its own, and two  from
       each posting)

   Displaying tags
       You can use the tags command to list tag names or values.

       The print command also shows tags.

       You  can use --pivot to display tag values in other reports, in various
       ways (eg appended to account names, like pseudo subaccounts).

   When to use tags ?
       Tags provide more dimensions of categorisation, complementing  accounts
       and  transaction descriptions.  When to use each of these is somewhat a
       matter of taste.  Accounts have the most built-in  support,  and  regex
       queries  on  descriptions are also quite powerful.  So you may not need
       tags at all.  But if you want to  track  multiple  cross-cutting  cate-
       gories,  they  can  be a good fit.  For example, you could tag trip-re-
       lated transactions with trip: YEAR:PLACE, without disturbing your usual
       account categories.

   Tag names
       What is allowed in a tag name ?  Currently, most non-whitespace charac-
       ters.  Eg : is a valid tag.

       For extra error checking, you can declare valid tag names with the  tag
       directive, and then enforce these with the check command.

       But  note  that  tags  are detected quite loosely at present, sometimes
       where you didn't intend them.  Eg  ;  see  https://foo.com  contains  a
       https tag with value //foo.com.

   Special tags
       Some  tag  names  have  special  significance to hledger.  They are ex-
       plained elsewhere, but here's a quick reference:

               type                   -- declares an account's type
               date                   -- overrides a posting's date
               date2                  -- overrides a posting's secondary date
               assert                 -- appears on txns generated by close --assert
               retain                 -- appears on txns generated by close --retain
               start                  -- appears on txns generated by close --migrate/--close/--open/--assign
               t                      -- appears on postings generated from timedot letters

               generated-transaction  -- appears on txns generated by a periodic rule
               modified-transaction   -- appears on txns which have had auto postings added
               generated-posting      -- appears on generated postings
               cost-posting           -- appears on postings which have (or could have) a cost,
                                         and which have equivalent conversion postings in the transaction
               conversion-posting     -- appears on postings which are to a V/Conversion account
                                         and which have an equivalent cost posting in the transaction

       The second group above (generated-transaction, etc.)  are normally hid-
       den, with a _ prefix added.  This means print doesn't show them by  de-
       fault;  but  you can still use them in queries.  You can add the --ver-
       bose-tags flag to make them visible, which  can  be  useful  for  trou-
       bleshooting.

   Directives
       Besides  transactions, there is something else you can put in a journal
       file: directives.  These are declarations, beginning  with  a  keyword,
       that  modify  hledger's  behaviour.  Some directives can have more spe-
       cific subdirectives, indented below  them.   hledger's  directives  are
       similar to Ledger's in many cases, but there are also many differences.
       Directives  are not required, but can be useful.  Here are the main di-
       rectives:

       purpose                                    directive
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------
       READING DATA:
       Rewrite account names                      alias
       Comment out sections of the file           comment
       Declare file's  decimal  mark,  to  help   decimal-mark
       parse amounts accurately
       Include other data files                   include
       GENERATING DATA:
       Generate  recurring transactions or bud-   ~
       get goals
       Generate  extra  postings  on   existing   =
       transactions
       CHECKING FOR ERRORS:
       Define  valid  entities  to provide more   account, commodity, payee, tag
       error checking
       REPORTING:
       Declare accounts' type and display order   account
       Declare commodity display styles           commodity
       Declare market prices                      P

   Directives and multiple files
       Directives vary in their scope, ie which journal entries and which  in-
       put files they affect.  Most often, a directive will affect the follow-
       ing  entries  and  included  files if any, until the end of the current
       file - and no further.  You might find this inconvenient!  For example,
       alias directives do not affect parent or sibling files.  But there  are
       usually workarounds; for example, put alias directives in your top-most
       file, before including other files.

       The  restriction,  though  it  may  be  annoying at first, is in a good
       cause; it allows reports to be stable and deterministic, independent of
       the order of input.  Without it, reports could show  different  numbers
       depending  on  the order of -f options, or the positions of include di-
       rectives in your files.

   Directive effects
       Here are all hledger's directives, with their effects  and  scope  sum-
       marised  -  nine  main  directives,  plus four others which we consider
       non-essential:

   account directive
       account directives can be used to declare accounts (ie, the places that
       amounts are transferred from and to).  Though not required, these  dec-
       larations can provide several benefits:

       o They can document your intended chart of accounts, providing a refer-
         ence.

       o They can store additional account information as comments, or as tags
         which can be used to filter or pivot reports.

       o They can restrict which accounts may be posted to by transactions, eg
         in strict mode, which helps prevent errors.

       o They  influence account display order in reports, allowing non-alpha-
         betic sorting (eg Revenues to appear above Expenses).

       o They can help hledger know your accounts'  types  (asset,  liability,
         equity, revenue, expense), enabling reports like balancesheet and in-
         comestatement.

       o They  help with account name completion (in hledger add, hledger-web,
         hledger-iadd, ledger-mode, etc.)

       They are written as the word account followed by  a  hledger-style  ac-
       count name.  Eg:

              account assets:bank:checking

       Ledger-style indented subdirectives are also accepted, but ignored:

              account assets:bank:checking
                format subdirective  ; currently ignored

   Account comments
       Text following two or more spaces and ; at the end of an account direc-
       tive  line,  and/or following ; on indented lines immediately below it,
       form comments for that account.  They are ignored except they may  con-
       tain tags, which are not ignored.

       The  two-space  requirement for same-line account comments is because ;
       is allowed in account names.

              account assets:bank:checking    ; same-line comment, at least 2 spaces before the semicolon
                ; next-line comment
                ; some tags - type:A, acctnum:12345

   Account error checking
       By default, accounts need not be declared;  they  come  into  existence
       when  a  posting  references  them.   This  is convenient, but it means
       hledger can't warn you when you mis-spell an account name in the  jour-
       nal.  Usually you'll find that error later, as an extra account in bal-
       ance reports, or an incorrect balance when reconciling.

       In  strict  mode,  enabled  with  the -s/--strict flag, or when you run
       hledger check accounts, hledger will report an error if any transaction
       uses an account name that has not been declared by  an  account  direc-
       tive.  Some notes:

       o The  declaration is case-sensitive; transactions must use the correct
         account name capitalisation.

       o The account directive's scope is "whole file and below"  (see  direc-
         tives).  This means it affects all of the current file, and any files
         it  includes,  but  not parent or sibling files.  The position of ac-
         count directives within the file does not matter, though  it's  usual
         to put them at the top.

       o Accounts  can  only be declared in journal files, but will affect in-
         cluded files of all types.

       o It's currently not possible to  declare  "all  possible  subaccounts"
         with a wildcard; every account posted to must be declared.

       o If  you  use the --infer-equity flag, you will also need declarations
         for the account names it generates.

   Account display order
       Account directives also cause hledger to display accounts in a particu-
       lar order, not just alphabetically.  Eg, here is a conventional  order-
       ing for the top-level accounts:

              account assets
              account liabilities
              account equity
              account revenues
              account expenses

       Now hledger displays them in that order:

              $ hledger accounts
              assets
              liabilities
              equity
              revenues
              expenses

       If  there are undeclared accounts, those will be displayed last, in al-
       phabetical order.

       Sorting is done within each group of sibling accounts, at each level of
       the account tree.  Eg, a declaration like account  parent:child  influ-
       ences child's position among its siblings.

       Note,  it  does not affect parent's position; for that, you need an ac-
       count parent declaration.

       Sibling accounts are always displayed together; hledger  won't  display
       x:y in between a:b and a:c.

       An  account  directive both declares an account as a valid posting tar-
       get, and declares its display order; you can't easily  do  one  without
       the other.

   Account types
       hledger knows that in accounting there are three main account types:

       Asset       A   things you own
       Liability   L   things you owe
       Equity      E   owner's investment,
                       balances   the  two
                       above

       and two more representing changes in these:

       Revenue   R   inflows (also known
                     as Income)
       Expense   X   outflows

       hledger also uses a couple of subtypes:

       Cash         C   liquid assets
       Conversion   V   commodity   conver-
                        sions equity

       As  a  convenience,  hledger will detect these types automatically from
       english account names.  But it's better to declare them  explicitly  by
       adding  a  type: tag in the account directives.  The tag's value can be
       any of the types or one-letter abbreviations above.

       Here is a typical set of account type declarations.   Subaccounts  will
       inherit their parent's type, or can override it:

              account assets             ; type: A
              account liabilities        ; type: L
              account equity             ; type: E
              account revenues           ; type: R
              account expenses           ; type: X

              account assets:bank        ; type: C
              account assets:cash        ; type: C

              account equity:conversion  ; type: V

       This  enables  the  easy balancesheet, balancesheetequity, cashflow and
       incomestatement reports, and querying by type:.

       Tips:

       o You can list accounts and their types, for troubleshooting:

                $ hledger accounts --types [ACCTPAT] [type:TYPECODES] [-DEPTH] [--positions]

       o It's a good idea to declare at least one  account  for  each  account
         type.   Having some types declared and some inferred can disrupt cer-
         tain reports.

       o The rules for inferring types from account names are as follows  (us-
         ing Regular expressions).
       If  they  don't  work  for you, just ignore them and declare your types
       with type: tags.

                If account's name contains this case insensitive regular expression | its type is
                --------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------
                ^assets?(:.+)?:(cash|bank|che(ck|que?)(ing)?|savings?|current)(:|$) | Cash
                ^assets?(:|$)                                                       | Asset
                ^(debts?|liabilit(y|ies))(:|$)                                      | Liability
                ^equity:(trad(e|ing)|conversion)s?(:|$)                             | Conversion
                ^equity(:|$)                                                        | Equity
                ^(income|revenue)s?(:|$)                                            | Revenue
                ^expenses?(:|$)                                                     | Expense

       o As mentioned above, subaccounts will inherit a type from their parent
         account.  To be precise, an account's type is decided by the first of
         these that exists:

         1. A type: declaration for this account.

         2. A type: declaration in the parent accounts  above  it,  preferring
            the nearest.

         3. An account type inferred from this account's name.

         4. An  account type inferred from a parent account's name, preferring
            the nearest parent.

         5. Otherwise, it will have no type.

       o Account aliases can disrupt account types.

   alias directive
       You can define account alias rules which rewrite your account names, or
       parts of them, before generating reports.  This can be useful for:

       o expanding shorthand account names to their full form, allowing easier
         data entry and a less verbose journal

       o adapting old journals to your current chart of accounts

       o experimenting with new account organisations, like a new hierarchy

       o combining two accounts into one, eg to see their sum or difference on
         one line

       o customising reports

       Account aliases also rewrite account names in account directives.  They
       do  not  affect  account  names  being  entered  via  hledger  add   or
       hledger-web.

       Account aliases are very powerful.  They are generally easy to use cor-
       rectly, but you can also generate invalid account names with them; more
       on this below.

       See also Rewrite account names.

   Basic aliases
       To  set an account alias, use the alias directive in your journal file.
       This affects all subsequent journal entries in the current file or  its
       included  files  (but  note:  not sibling or parent files).  The spaces
       around the = are optional:

              alias OLD = NEW

       Or, you can use the --alias 'OLD=NEW' option on the command line.  This
       affects all entries.  It's useful for trying out aliases interactively.

       OLD and NEW are case sensitive full account names.   hledger  will  re-
       place  any occurrence of the old account name with the new one.  Subac-
       counts are also affected.  Eg:

              alias checking = assets:bank:wells fargo:checking
              ; rewrites "checking" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking", or "checking:a" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking:a"

   Regex aliases
       There is also a more powerful variant that uses a  regular  expression,
       indicated  by  wrapping  the  pattern in forward slashes.  (This is the
       only place where hledger requires forward slashes around a regular  ex-
       pression.)

       Eg:

              alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT

       or:

              $ hledger --alias '/REGEX/=REPLACEMENT' ...

       Any  part  of  an account name matched by REGEX will be replaced by RE-
       PLACEMENT.  REGEX is case-insensitive as usual.

       If you need to match a forward slash, escape it with  a  backslash,  eg
       /\/=:.

       If  REGEX  contains parenthesised match groups, these can be referenced
       by the usual backslash and number in REPLACEMENT:

              alias /^(.+):bank:([^:]+):(.*)/ = \1:\2 \3
              ; rewrites "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking" to  "assets:wells fargo checking"

       REPLACEMENT continues to the end of line (or on command line, to end of
       option argument), so it can contain trailing whitespace.

   Combining aliases
       You can define as many aliases as you like,  using  journal  directives
       and/or command line options.

       Recursive  aliases  -  where an account name is rewritten by one alias,
       then by another alias, and so on - are allowed.  Each  alias  sees  the
       effect of previously applied aliases.

       In  such  cases it can be important to understand which aliases will be
       applied and in which order.  For (each account name  in)  each  journal
       entry, we apply:

       1. alias  directives  preceding the journal entry, most recently parsed
          first (ie, reading upward from the journal entry, bottom to top)

       2. --alias options, in the order they  appeared  on  the  command  line
          (left to right).

       In other words, for (an account name in) a given journal entry:

       o the nearest alias declaration before/above the entry is applied first

       o the next alias before/above that will be be applied next, and so on

       o aliases defined after/below the entry do not affect it.

       This  gives nearby aliases precedence over distant ones, and helps pro-
       vide semantic stability - aliases will keep working the same way  inde-
       pendent of which files are being read and in which order.

       In  case  of  trouble,  adding  --debug=6 to the command line will show
       which aliases are being applied when.

   Aliases and multiple files
       As explained at Directives and multiple files, alias directives do  not
       affect parent or sibling files.  Eg in this command,

              hledger -f a.aliases -f b.journal

       account  aliases  defined  in a.aliases will not affect b.journal.  In-
       cluding the aliases doesn't work either:

              include a.aliases

              2023-01-01  ; not affected by a.aliases
                foo  1
                bar

       This means that account aliases should usually be declared at the start
       of your top-most file, like this:

              alias foo=Foo
              alias bar=Bar

              2023-01-01  ; affected by aliases above
                foo  1
                bar

              include c.journal  ; also affected

   end aliases directive
       You can clear (forget) all currently defined aliases (seen in the jour-
       nal so far, or defined on the command line) with this directive:

              end aliases

   Aliases can generate bad account names
       Be aware that account aliases  can  produce  malformed  account  names,
       which could cause confusing reports or invalid print output.  For exam-
       ple, you could erase all account names:

              2021-01-01
                a:aa     1
                b

              $ hledger print --alias '/.*/='
              2021-01-01
                                 1

       The  above print output is not a valid journal.  Or you could insert an
       illegal double space, causing print output that would give a  different
       journal when reparsed:

              2021-01-01
                old    1
                other

              $ hledger print --alias old="new  USD" | hledger -f- print
              2021-01-01
                  new             USD 1
                  other

   Aliases and account types
       If an account with a type declaration (see Declaring accounts > Account
       types) is renamed by an alias, normally the account type remains in ef-
       fect.

       However,  renaming in a way that reshapes the account tree (eg renaming
       parent accounts but not their children, or vice  versa)  could  prevent
       child accounts from inheriting the account type of their parents.

       Secondly,  if an account's type is being inferred from its name, renam-
       ing it by an alias could prevent or alter that.

       If you are using account aliases and the type: query  is  not  matching
       accounts  as you expect, try troubleshooting with the accounts command,
       eg something like:

              $ hledger accounts --types -1 --alias assets=bassetts

   commodity directive
       The commodity directive performs several functions:

       1. It declares which commodity symbols may be used in the journal,  en-
          abling  useful error checking with strict mode or the check command.
          See Commodity error checking below.

       2. It declares how all amounts in this commodity should  be  displayed,
          eg how many decimals to show.  See Commodity display style above.

       3. (If  no  decimal-mark  directive  is in effect:) It sets the decimal
          mark to expect (period or comma) when parsing amounts in  this  com-
          modity, in this file and files it includes, from the directive until
          end of current file.  See Decimal marks above.

       4. It declares the precision with which this commodity's amounts should
          be  compared  when  checking  for balanced transactions, anywhere in
          this file and files it includes, until end of current file.

       Declaring commodities solves several common  parsing/display  problems,
       so we recommend it.

       Note that effects 3 and 4 above end at the end of the directive's file,
       and  will not affect sibling or parent files.  So if you are relying on
       them (especially 4) and using multiple files,  placing  your  commodity
       directives  in  a  top-level  parent file might be important.  Or, keep
       your decimal marks unambiguous and your entries well balanced and  pre-
       cise.

       (Related: #793)

   Commodity directive syntax
       A commodity directive is normally the word commodity followed by a sam-
       ple  amount  (and  optionally a comment).  Only the amount's symbol and
       the number's format is significant.  Eg:

              commodity $1000.00
              commodity 1.000,00 EUR
              commodity 1 000 000.0000   ; the no-symbol commodity

       Commodities do not have tags (tags in the comment will be ignored).

       A commodity directive's sample amount must always include a  period  or
       comma  decimal  mark  (this  rule  helps disambiguate decimal marks and
       digit group marks).  If you don't want  to  show  any  decimal  digits,
       write the decimal mark at the end:

              commodity 1000. AAAA       ; show AAAA with no decimals

       Commodity  symbols  containing  spaces, numbers, or punctuation must be
       enclosed in double quotes, as usual:

              commodity 1.0000 "AAAA 2023"

       Commodity directives normally include a sample amount, but can  declare
       only a symbol (ie, just function 1 above):

              commodity $
              commodity INR
              commodity "AAAA 2023"
              commodity ""               ; the no-symbol commodity

       Commodity directives may also be written with an indented format subdi-
       rective,  as in Ledger.  The symbol is repeated and must be the same in
       both places.  Other subdirectives are currently ignored:

              ; display indian rupees with currency name on the left,
              ; thousands, lakhs and crores comma-separated,
              ; period as decimal point, and two decimal places.
              commodity INR
                format INR 1,00,00,000.00
                an unsupported subdirective  ; ignored by hledger

   Commodity error checking
       In strict mode (-s/--strict) (or when you run  hledger  check  commodi-
       ties),  hledger  will report an error if an undeclared commodity symbol
       is used.  (With one exception: zero amounts are always allowed to  have
       no  commodity symbol.)  It works like account error checking (described
       above).

   decimal-mark directive
       You can use a decimal-mark directive - usually one per file, at the top
       of the file - to declare which character represents a decimal mark when
       parsing amounts in this file.  It can look like

              decimal-mark .

       or

              decimal-mark ,

       This prevents any ambiguity when parsing numbers in  the  file,  so  we
       recommend  it,  especially  if  the file contains digit group marks (eg
       thousands separators).

   include directive
       You can pull in the content of additional files by writing  an  include
       directive, like this:

              include FILEPATH

       Only  journal files can include, and only journal, timeclock or timedot
       files can be included (not CSV files, currently).

       If the file path does not begin with a slash, it  is  relative  to  the
       current file's folder.

       A tilde means home directory, eg: include ~/main.journal.

       The path may contain glob patterns to match multiple files, eg: include
       *.journal.

       There is limited support for recursive wildcards: **/ (the slash is re-
       quired)  matches  0  or more subdirectories.  It's not super convenient
       since you have to avoid include cycles and including  directories,  but
       this can be done, eg: include */**/*.journal.

       The path may also be prefixed to force a specific file format, overrid-
       ing  the  file  extension (as described in Data formats): include time-
       dot:~/notes/2023*.md.

   P directive
       The P directive declares a market price, which is a conversion rate be-
       tween two commodities on a certain date.  This allows value reports  to
       convert amounts of one commodity to their value in another, on or after
       that  date.   These  prices  are  often obtained from a stock exchange,
       cryptocurrency exchange, the or foreign exchange market.

       The format is:

              P DATE COMMODITY1SYMBOL COMMODITY2AMOUNT

       DATE is a simple date, COMMODITY1SYMBOL is the symbol of the  commodity
       being  priced, and COMMODITY2AMOUNT is the amount (symbol and quantity)
       of commodity 2 that one unit of commodity 1 is worth on this date.  Ex-
       amples:

              # one euro was worth $1.35 from 2009-01-01 onward:
              P 2009-01-01  $1.35

              # and $1.40 from 2010-01-01 onward:
              P 2010-01-01  $1.40

       The -V, -X and --value flags use these market  prices  to  show  amount
       values in another commodity.  See Value reporting.

   payee directive
       payee PAYEE NAME

       This directive can be used to declare a limited set of payees which may
       appear  in transaction descriptions.  The "payees" check will report an
       error if any transaction refers to a payee that has not been  declared.
       Eg:

              payee Whole Foods    ; a comment

       Payees do not have tags (tags in the comment will be ignored).

       To declare the empty payee name, use "".

              payee ""

       Ledger-style indented subdirectives, if any, are currently ignored.

   tag directive
       tag TAGNAME

       This  directive  can  be used to declare a limited set of tag names al-
       lowed in tags.  TAGNAME should be a valid tag name (no spaces).  Eg:

              tag  item-id

       Any indented subdirectives are currently ignored.

       The "tags" check will report an error if any  undeclared  tag  name  is
       used.  It is quite easy to accidentally create a tag through normal use
       of colons in comments; if you want to prevent this, you can declare and
       check your tags .

   Periodic transactions
       The  ~  directive  declares a "periodic rule" which generates temporary
       extra transactions, usually recurring at some interval, when hledger is
       run with the --forecast flag.  These "forecast transactions" are useful
       for forecasting future activity.  They exist only for the  duration  of
       the report, and only when --forecast is used; they are not saved in the
       journal file by hledger.

       Periodic  rules also have a second use: with the --budget flag they set
       budget goals for budgeting.

       Periodic rules can be a little tricky, so before  you  use  them,  read
       this whole section, or at least the following tips:

       1. Two  spaces  accidentally  added or omitted will cause you trouble -
          read about this below.

       2. For troubleshooting, show the generated  transactions  with  hledger
          print   --forecast  tag:generated  or  hledger  register  --forecast
          tag:generated.

       3. Forecasted transactions will begin only  after  the  last  non-fore-
          casted transaction's date.

       4. Forecasted  transactions  will  end 6 months from today, by default.
          See below for the exact start/end rules.

       5. period expressions can be tricky.   Their  documentation  needs  im-
          provement, but is worth studying.

       6. Some  period  expressions  with a repeating interval must begin on a
          natural boundary of that interval.  Eg in  weekly  from  DATE,  DATE
          must  be a monday.  ~ weekly from 2019/10/1 (a tuesday) will give an
          error.

       7. Other period expressions with an interval are automatically expanded
          to cover a whole number of that interval.  (This is done to  improve
          reports, but it also affects periodic transactions.  Yes, it's a bit
          inconsistent  with  the above.)  Eg:  ~ every 10th day of month from
          2023/01, which is equivalent to  ~ every  10th  day  of  month  from
          2023/01/01, will be adjusted to start on 2019/12/10.

   Periodic rule syntax
       A periodic transaction rule looks like a normal journal entry, with the
       date replaced by a tilde (~) followed by a period expression (mnemonic:
       ~ looks like a recurring sine wave.):

              # every first of month
              ~ monthly
                  expenses:rent          $2000
                  assets:bank:checking

              # every 15th of month in 2023's first quarter:
              ~ monthly from 2023-04-15 to 2023-06-16
                  expenses:utilities          $400
                  assets:bank:checking

       The  period expression is the same syntax used for specifying multi-pe-
       riod reports, just interpreted differently; there, it specifies  report
       periods; here it specifies recurrence dates (the periods' start dates).

   Periodic rules and relative dates
       Partial  or  relative  dates (like 12/31, 25, tomorrow, last week, next
       quarter) are usually not recommended in periodic rules, since  the  re-
       sults  will  change  as time passes.  If used, they will be interpreted
       relative to, in order of preference:

       1. the first day of the default year specified by a recent Y directive

       2. or the date specified with --today

       3. or the date on which you are running the report.

       They will not be affected at all by report period  or  forecast  period
       dates.

   Two spaces between period expression and description!
       If  the  period  expression  is  followed by a transaction description,
       these must be separated by two or more spaces.  This helps hledger know
       where the period expression ends, so that descriptions can not acciden-
       tally alter their meaning, as in this example:

              ; 2 or more spaces needed here, so the period is not understood as "every 2 months in 2023"
              ;               ||
              ;               vv
              ~ every 2 months  in 2023, we will review
                  assets:bank:checking   $1500
                  income:acme inc

       So,

       o Do write two spaces between your period expression and your  transac-
         tion description, if any.

       o Don't  accidentally write two spaces in the middle of your period ex-
         pression.

   Auto postings
       The = directive declares an "auto posting rule", which adds extra post-
       ings to existing transactions.  (Remember,  postings  are  the  account
       name & amount lines below a transaction's date & description.)

       In  the  journal,  an auto posting rule looks quite like a transaction,
       but instead of date and description it has = (mnemonic: "match") and  a
       query, like this:

              = QUERY
                  ACCOUNT    AMOUNT
                  ...

       Queries  are  just like command line queries; an account name substring
       is most common.  Query terms containing spaces should  be  enclosed  in
       single or double quotes.

       Each  = rule works like this: when hledger is run with the --auto flag,
       wherever the QUERY matches a posting in the journal, the  rule's  post-
       ings are added to that transaction, immediately below the matched post-
       ing.   Note  these  generated postings are temporary, existing only for
       the duration of the report, and only when --auto is used; they are  not
       saved in the journal file by hledger.

       Generated postings' amounts can depend on the matched posting's amount.
       So  auto  postings  can  be  useful for, eg, adding tax postings with a
       standard percentage.  AMOUNT can be:

       o a number with no commodity symbol, like  2.   The  matched  posting's
         commodity symbol will be added to this.

       o a  normal amount with a commodity symbol, like $2.  This will be used
         as-is.

       o an asterisk followed by a number, like *2.  This  will  multiply  the
         matched posting's amount (and total price, if any) by the number.

       o an  asterisk  followed  by an amount with commodity symbol, like *$2.
         This multiplies and also replaces the commodity symbol with this  new
         one.

       Some examples:

              ; every time I buy food, schedule a dollar donation
              = expenses:food
                  (liabilities:charity)   $-1

              ; when I buy a gift, also deduct that amount from a budget envelope subaccount
              = expenses:gifts
                  assets:checking:gifts  *-1
                  assets:checking         *1

              2017/12/1
                expenses:food    $10
                assets:checking

              2017/12/14
                expenses:gifts   $20
                assets:checking

              $ hledger print --auto
              2017-12-01
                  expenses:food              $10
                  assets:checking
                  (liabilities:charity)      $-1

              2017-12-14
                  expenses:gifts             $20
                  assets:checking
                  assets:checking:gifts     -$20
                  assets:checking            $20

       Note that depending fully on generated data such as this has some draw-
       backs  -  it's less portable, less future-proof, less auditable by oth-
       ers, and less robust (eg your balance assertions will depend on whether
       you use or don't use --auto).  An alternative is to use  auto  postings
       in "one time" fashion - use them to help build a complex journal entry,
       view  it  with hledger print --auto, and then copy that output into the
       journal file to make it permanent.

   Auto postings and multiple files
       An auto posting rule can affect any transaction in the current file, or
       in any parent file or child file.  Note, currently it will  not  affect
       sibling files (when multiple -f/--file are used - see #1212).

   Auto postings and dates
       A  posting  date (or secondary date) in the matched posting, or (taking
       precedence) a posting date in the auto posting rule itself,  will  also
       be used in the generated posting.

   Auto postings and transaction balancing / inferred amounts / balance asser-
       tions
       Currently, auto postings are added:

       o after  missing amounts are inferred, and transactions are checked for
         balancedness,

       o but before balance assertions are checked.

       Note this means that journal entries must be balanced both  before  and
       after auto postings are added.  This changed in hledger 1.12+; see #893
       for background.

       This  also means that you cannot have more than one auto-posting with a
       missing amount applied to a given transaction, as it will be unable  to
       infer amounts.

   Auto posting tags
       Automated postings will have some extra tags:

       o generated-posting:= QUERY - shows this was generated by an auto post-
         ing rule, and the query

       o _generated-posting:=  QUERY  - a hidden tag, which does not appear in
         hledger's output.  This can be used to match postings generated "just
         now", rather than generated in the past and saved to the journal.

       Also, any transaction that has been changed by auto posting rules  will
       have these tags added:

       o modified: - this transaction was modified

       o _modified: - a hidden tag not appearing in the comment; this transac-
         tion was modified "just now".

   Auto postings on forecast transactions only
       Tip:  you can can make auto postings that will apply to forecast trans-
       actions but not recorded transactions, by adding  tag:_generated-trans-
       action  to their QUERY.  This can be useful when generating new journal
       entries to be saved in the journal.

   Other syntax
       hledger journal format supports quite a few other features,  mainly  to
       make  interoperating  with or converting from Ledger easier.  Note some
       of the features below are powerful and can be useful in special  cases,
       but  in general, features in this section are considered less important
       or even not recommended for most users.   Downsides  are  mentioned  to
       help you decide if you want to use them.

   Balance assignments
       Ledger-style  balance  assignments  are also supported.  These are like
       balance assertions, but with no posting amount on the left side of  the
       equals  sign;  instead  it is calculated automatically so as to satisfy
       the assertion.  This can be a convenience during data  entry,  eg  when
       setting opening balances:

              ; starting a new journal, set asset account balances
              2016/1/1 opening balances
                assets:checking            = $409.32
                assets:savings             = $735.24
                assets:cash                 = $42
                equity:opening balances

       or when adjusting a balance to reality:

              ; no cash left; update balance, record any untracked spending as a generic expense
              2016/1/15
                assets:cash    = $0
                expenses:misc

       The calculated amount depends on the account's balance in the commodity
       at  that  point  (which depends on the previously-dated postings of the
       commodity to that account since the last balance assertion  or  assign-
       ment).

       Downsides:  using balance assignments makes your journal less explicit;
       to know the exact amount posted, you have to run hledger or do the cal-
       culations yourself, instead of just reading it.  Also  balance  assign-
       ments' forcing of balances can hide errors.  These things make your fi-
       nancial  data less portable, less future-proof, and less trustworthy in
       an audit.

   Balance assignments and costs
       A cost in a balance assignment will cause the calculated amount to have
       that cost attached:

              2019/1/1
                (a)             = $1 @ 2

              $ hledger print --explicit
              2019-01-01
                  (a)         $1 @ 2 = $1 @ 2

   Balance assignments and multiple files
       Balance assignments handle  multiple  files  like  balance  assertions.
       They  see balance from other files previously included from the current
       file, but not from previous sibling or parent files.

   Bracketed posting dates
       For setting posting dates and secondary posting dates, Ledger's  brack-
       eted date syntax is also supported: [DATE], [DATE=DATE2] or [=DATE2] in
       posting  comments.   hledger will attempt to parse any square-bracketed
       sequence of the 0123456789/-.= characters in this way.  With this  syn-
       tax,  DATE  infers  its  year from the transaction and DATE2 infers its
       year from DATE.

       Downsides:  another  syntax  to   learn,   redundant   with   hledger's
       date:/date2: tags, and confusingly similar to Ledger's lot date syntax.

   D directive
       D AMOUNT

       This  directive sets a default commodity, to be used for any subsequent
       commodityless amounts (ie, plain numbers) seen while parsing the  jour-
       nal.   This  effect lasts until the next D directive, or the end of the
       current file.

       For compatibility/historical reasons, D also acts like a commodity  di-
       rective  (setting  the commodity's decimal mark for parsing and display
       style for output).  So its argument is not just a commodity symbol, but
       a full amount demonstrating the style.  The amount must include a deci-
       mal mark (either period or comma).  Eg:

              ; commodity-less amounts should be treated as dollars
              ; (and displayed with the dollar sign on the left, thousands separators and two decimal places)
              D $1,000.00

              1/1
                a     5  ; <- commodity-less amount, parsed as $5 and displayed as $5.00
                b

       Interactions with other directives:

       For setting a commodity's display  style,  a  commodity  directive  has
       highest priority, then a D directive.

       For  detecting  a commodity's decimal mark during parsing, decimal-mark
       has highest priority, then commodity, then D.

       For checking commodity symbols with the check command, a commodity  di-
       rective is required (hledger check commodities ignores D directives).

       Downsides:  omitting  commodity  symbols makes your financial data less
       explicit, less portable, and less trustworthy in an audit.  It is  usu-
       ally  an unsustainable shortcut; sooner or later you will want to track
       multiple commodities.  D is overloaded with  functions  redundant  with
       commodity and decimal-mark.  And it works differently from Ledger's D.

   apply account directive
       This  directive  sets a default parent account, which will be prepended
       to all accounts in following entries, until an end apply account direc-
       tive or end of current file.  Eg:

              apply account home

              2010/1/1
                  food    $10
                  cash

              end apply account

       is equivalent to:

              2010/01/01
                  home:food           $10
                  home:cash          $-10

       account directives are also affected, and so is any included content.

       Account names entered via hledger add or hledger-web are not affected.

       Account aliases, if any,  are  applied  after  the  parent  account  is
       prepended.

       Downsides:  this  can  make  your  financial  data  less explicit, less
       portable, and less trustworthy in an audit.

   Y directive
       Y YEAR

       or (deprecated backward-compatible forms):

       year YEAR apply year YEAR

       The space is optional.  This sets a default year to be used for  subse-
       quent dates which don't specify a year.  Eg:

              Y2009  ; set default year to 2009

              12/15  ; equivalent to 2009/12/15
                expenses  1
                assets

              year 2010  ; change default year to 2010

              2009/1/30  ; specifies the year, not affected
                expenses  1
                assets

              1/31   ; equivalent to 2010/1/31
                expenses  1
                assets

       Downsides: omitting the year (from primary transaction dates, at least)
       makes your financial data less explicit, less portable, and less trust-
       worthy  in  an  audit.   Such dates can get separated from their corre-
       sponding Y directive, eg when evaluating a region  of  the  journal  in
       your  editor.  A missing Y directive makes reports dependent on today's
       date.

   Secondary dates
       A secondary date is written after the primary date, following an equals
       sign: DATE1=DATE2.  If the year is omitted, the primary date's year  is
       assumed.  When running reports, the primary (left side) date is used by
       default, but with the --date2 flag (--aux-date or--effective also work,
       for  Ledger  users),  the  secondary (right side) date will be used in-
       stead.

       The meaning of secondary dates is up to you.  Eg it could  be  "primary
       is  the bank's clearing date, secondary is the date the transaction was
       initiated, if different".

       In practice, this feature usually adds confusion:

       o You have to remember the primary and secondary  dates'  meaning,  and
         follow that consistently.

       o It  splits  your bookkeeping into two modes, and you have to remember
         which mode is appropriate for a given report.

       o Usually your balance assertions will work  with  only  one  of  these
         modes.

       o It  makes  your  financial  data more complicated, less portable, and
         less clear in an audit.

       o It interacts with every feature, creating an ongoing cost for  imple-
         mentors.

       o It distracts new users and supporters.

       o Posting dates are simpler and work better.

       So secondary dates are officially deprecated in hledger, remaining only
       as  a  Ledger  compatibility  aid; we recommend using posting dates in-
       stead.

   Star comments
       Lines beginning with * (star/asterisk) are also  comment  lines.   This
       feature allows Emacs users to insert org headings in their journal, al-
       lowing them to fold/unfold/navigate it like an outline when viewed with
       org mode.

       Downsides:  another, unconventional comment syntax to learn.  Decreases
       your journal's portability.  And switching to Emacs org mode  just  for
       folding/unfolding  meant  losing  the benefits of ledger mode; nowadays
       you can add outshine mode to ledger mode to get folding without  losing
       ledger mode's features.

   Valuation expressions
       Ledger  allows  a  valuation  function or value to be written in double
       parentheses after an amount.  hledger ignores these.

   Virtual postings
       A posting with parentheses around the account name, like (some:account)
       10, is called an unbalanced virtual posting.   These  postings  do  not
       participate  in  transaction balancing.  (And if you write them without
       an amount, a zero amount is always inferred.)  These  can  occasionally
       be  convenient for special circumstances, but they violate double entry
       bookkeeping and make your data less portable  across  applications,  so
       many people avoid using them at all.

       A  posting  with  brackets  around the account name ([some:account]) is
       called a balanced virtual posting.  The balanced virtual postings in  a
       transaction must add up to zero, just like ordinary postings, but sepa-
       rately  from  them.  These are not part of double entry bookkeeping ei-
       ther, but they are at least balanced.  An example:

              2022-01-01 buy food with cash, update budget envelope subaccounts, & something else
                assets:cash                    $-10  ; <- these balance each other
                expenses:food                    $7  ; <-
                expenses:food                    $3  ; <-
                [assets:checking:budget:food]  $-10  ;   <- and these balance each other
                [assets:checking:available]     $10  ;   <-
                (something:else)                 $5  ;     <- this is not required to balance

       Ordinary postings, whose account names are  neither  parenthesised  nor
       bracketed,  are called real postings.  You can exclude virtual postings
       from reports with the -R/--real flag or a real:1 query.

   Other Ledger directives
       These other Ledger directives are currently accepted but ignored.  This
       allows hledger to read more Ledger files, but be aware  that  hledger's
       reports may differ from Ledger's if you use these.

              apply fixed COMM AMT
              apply tag   TAG
              assert      EXPR
              bucket / A  ACCT
              capture     ACCT REGEX
              check       EXPR
              define      VAR=EXPR
              end apply fixed
              end apply tag
              end apply year
              end tag
              eval / expr EXPR
              python
                PYTHONCODE

              --command-line-flags

       syntax comparison.

   Other cost/lot notations
       A slight digression for Ledger and Beancount users.

       Ledger has a number of cost/lot-related notations:

       o @ UNITCOST and @@ TOTALCOST

         o expresses a conversion rate, as in hledger

         o when buying, also creates a lot that can  be  selected  at  selling
           time

       o (@) UNITCOST and (@@) TOTALCOST (virtual cost)

         o like  the  above,  but also means "this cost was exceptional, don't
           use it when inferring market prices".

       o {=UNITCOST} and {{=TOTALCOST}} (fixed price)

         o when buying, means "this cost is also the fixed value, don't let it
           fluctuate in value reports"

       o {UNITCOST} and {{TOTALCOST}} (lot price)

         o can be used identically to @ UNITCOST and @@ TOTALCOST,  also  cre-
           ates a lot

         o when  selling,  combined with @ ..., selects an existing lot by its
           cost basis.  Does not check if that lot is present.

       o [YYYY/MM/DD] (lot date)

         o when buying, attaches this acquisition date to the lot

         o when selling, selects a lot by its acquisition date

       o (SOME TEXT) (lot note)

         o when buying, attaches this note to the lot

         o when selling, selects a lot by its note

       Currently, hledger

       o accepts any or all of the above in any order after the posting amount

       o supports @ and @@

       o treats (@) and (@@) as synonyms for @ and @@

       o and ignores the rest.  (This can break transaction balancing.)

       Beancount has simpler notation and different behaviour:

       o @ UNITCOST and @@ TOTALCOST

         o expresses a cost without creating a lot, as in hledger

         o when buying (acquiring) or selling (disposing of) a lot,  and  com-
           bined  with  {...}: is not used except to document the cost/selling
           price

       o {UNITCOST} and {{TOTALCOST}}

         o when buying, expresses the cost for transaction balancing, and also
           creates a lot with this cost basis attached

         o when selling,

           o selects a lot by its cost basis

           o raises an error if that lot is not present or can not be selected
             unambiguously (depending on booking method configured)

           o expresses the selling price for transaction balancing

       o {},  {YYYY-MM-DD},   {"LABEL"},   {UNITCOST,   "LABEL"},   {UNITCOST,
         YYYY-MM-DD, "LABEL"}

         o when  selling,  other  combinations  of  date/cost/label,  like the
           above, are accepted for selecting the lot.

       Currently, hledger

       o supports @ and @@

       o accepts the {UNITCOST}/{{TOTALCOST}} notation, but ignores it

       o and rejects the rest.

CSV
       hledger can read transactions from CSV (comma-separated values)  files.
       More  precisely,  it  can read DSV (delimiter-separated values), from a
       file  or  standard  input.   Comma-separated,  semicolon-separated  and
       tab-separated  are the most common variants, and hledger will recognise
       these three automatically based on a .csv, .ssv or .tsv file  name  ex-
       tension or a csv:, ssv: or tsv: file path prefix.

       (To learn about producing CSV or TSV output, see Output format.)

       Each  CSV  file  must be described by a corresponding rules file.  This
       contains rules describing the CSV data  (header  line,  fields  layout,
       date  format  etc.), how to construct hledger transactions from it, and
       how to categorise transactions based on description  or  other  attrib-
       utes.

       By  default,  hledger  expects this rules file to be named like the CSV
       file, with an extra .rules extension added, in the same directory.   Eg
       when  asked to read foo/FILE.csv, hledger looks for foo/FILE.csv.rules.
       You can specify a different rules file with the --rules option.

       At minimum, the rules file must identify the date  and  amount  fields,
       and  often  it also specifies the date format and how many header lines
       there are.  Here's a simple CSV file and a rules file for it:

              Date, Description, Id, Amount
              12/11/2019, Foo, 123, 10.23

              # basic.csv.rules
              skip         1
              fields       date, description, , amount
              date-format  %d/%m/%Y

              $ hledger print -f basic.csv
              2019-11-12 Foo
                  expenses:unknown           10.23
                  income:unknown            -10.23

       There's an introductory Tutorial: Import CSV data on  hledger.org,  and
       more   CSV   rules   examples   below,   and  a  larger  collection  at
       https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/examples/csv.

       Field assignment           assign a CSV value or interpolated text  value

       if table                   conditionally assign values to hledger fields,

       include                    inline another CSV rules file

       Working with CSV tips can be found below, including How CSV  rules  are
       evaluated.

   source
       If  you  tell  hledger to read a csv file with -f foo.csv, it will look
       for rules in foo.csv.rules.  Or, you can tell  it  to  read  the  rules
       file,  with  -f  foo.csv.rules,  and  it  will look for data in foo.csv
       (since 1.30).

       These are mostly equivalent, but the second method provides some  extra
       features.   For  one,  the data file can be missing, without causing an
       error; it is just considered empty.  And, you can specify  a  different
       data file by adding a "source" rule:

              source ./Checking1.csv

       If  you specify just a file name with no path, hledger will look for it
       in your system's downloads directory (~/Downloads, currently):

              source Checking1.csv

       And if you specify a glob pattern, hledger will read the most recent of
       the matched files (useful with repeated downloads):

              source Checking1*.csv

       See also "Working with CSV > Reading files specified by rule".

   encoding
              encoding ENCODING

       hledger normally expects non-ascii text to be using the system locale's
       text encoding.  If you need to read CSV files which have some other en-
       coding, you can do it by adding encoding ENCODING to  your  CSV  rules.
       Eg: encoding iso-8859-1.

       The following encodings are supported:

       ascii,  utf-8,  utf-16,  utf-32,  iso-8859-1,  iso-8859-2,  iso-8859-3,
       iso-8859-4, iso-8859-5, iso-8859-6, iso-8859-7, iso-8859-8, iso-8859-9,
       iso-8859-10,  iso-8859-11,   iso-8859-13,   iso-8859-14,   iso-8859-15,
       iso-8859-16,  cp1250,  cp1251,  cp1252, cp1253, cp1254, cp1255, cp1256,
       cp1257,  cp1258,  koi8-r,  koi8-u,  gb18030,   macintosh,   jis-x-0201,
       jis-x-0208,  iso-2022-jp, shift-jis, cp437, cp737, cp775, cp850, cp852,
       cp855, cp857, cp860, cp861, cp862, cp863, cp864, cp865,  cp866,  cp869,
       cp874, cp932.

       Added in 1.42.

   separator
       You  can  use the separator rule to read other kinds of character-sepa-
       rated data.  The argument is any single  separator  character,  or  the
       words  tab or space (case insensitive).  Eg, for comma-separated values
       (CSV):

              separator ,

       or for semicolon-separated values (SSV):

              separator ;

       or for tab-separated values (TSV):

              separator TAB

       If the input file has a .csv, .ssv or .tsv file extension (or  a  csv:,
       ssv:, tsv: prefix), the appropriate separator will be inferred automat-
       ically, and you won't need this rule.

   skip
              skip N

       The  word  skip  followed  by  a number (or no number, meaning 1) tells
       hledger to ignore this many non-empty lines at the start of  the  input
       data.   You'll  need this whenever your CSV data contains header lines.
       Note, empty and blank lines are skipped  automatically,  so  you  don't
       need to count those.

       skip  has  a second meaning: it can be used inside if blocks (described
       below), to skip one or more records whenever  the  condition  is  true.
       Records skipped in this way are ignored, except they are still required
       to be valid CSV.

   date-format
              date-format DATEFMT

       This  is  a  helper for the date (and date2) fields.  If your CSV dates
       are not formatted like YYYY-MM-DD,  YYYY/MM/DD  or  YYYY.MM.DD,  you'll
       need  to  add  a date-format rule describing them with a strptime-style
       date   parsing   pattern   -   see    https://hackage.haskell.org/pack-
       age/time/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#v:formatTime.    The  pattern  must
       parse the CSV date value completely.  Some examples:

              # MM/DD/YY
              date-format %m/%d/%y

              # D/M/YYYY
              # The - makes leading zeros optional.
              date-format %-d/%-m/%Y

              # YYYY-Mmm-DD
              date-format %Y-%h-%d

              # M/D/YYYY HH:MM AM some other junk
              # Note the time and junk must be fully parsed, though only the date is used.
              date-format %-m/%-d/%Y %l:%M %p some other junk

   timezone
              timezone TIMEZONE

       When CSV contains date-times that are  implicitly  in  some  time  zone
       other than yours, but containing no explicit time zone information, you
       can  use  this  rule to declare the CSV's native time zone, which helps
       prevent off-by-one dates.

       When the CSV date-times do contain time  zone  information,  you  don't
       need  this  rule;  instead, use %Z in date-format (or %z, %EZ, %Ez; see
       the formatTime link above).

       In either of these cases, hledger will do a time-zone-aware conversion,
       localising the CSV date-times to your current system time zone.  If you
       prefer to localise to some other time zone, eg for reproducibility, you
       can (on unix at least) set the output timezone with the TZ  environment
       variable, eg:

              $ TZ=-1000 hledger print -f foo.csv  # or TZ=-1000 hledger import foo.csv

       timezone  currently  does  not understand timezone names, except "UTC",
       "GMT", "EST", "EDT", "CST", "CDT", "MST", "MDT", "PST", or "PDT".   For
       others, use numeric format: +HHMM or -HHMM.

   newest-first
       hledger tries to ensure that the generated transactions will be ordered
       chronologically,  including  same-day  transactions.   Usually  it  can
       auto-detect how the CSV records are ordered.  But if it encounters  CSV
       where all records are on the same date, it assumes that the records are
       oldest  first.  If in fact the CSV's records are normally newest first,
       like:

              2022-10-01, txn 3...
              2022-10-01, txn 2...
              2022-10-01, txn 1...

       you can add the newest-first rule to help hledger generate the transac-
       tions in correct order.

              # same-day CSV records are newest first
              newest-first

   intra-day-reversed
       If CSV records within a single day are ordered opposite to the  overall
       record  order,  you  can add the intra-day-reversed rule to improve the
       order of journal entries.  Eg, here the overall record order is  newest
       first, but same-day records are oldest first:

              2022-10-02, txn 3...
              2022-10-02, txn 4...
              2022-10-01, txn 1...
              2022-10-01, txn 2...

              # transactions within each day are reversed with respect to the overall date order
              intra-day-reversed

   decimal-mark
              decimal-mark .

       or:

              decimal-mark ,

       hledger  automatically accepts either period or comma as a decimal mark
       when parsing numbers (cf Amounts).  However if any numbers in  the  CSV
       contain  digit  group  marks,  such  as thousand-separating commas, you
       should declare the decimal mark explicitly with  this  rule,  to  avoid
       misparsed numbers.

   fields list
              fields FIELDNAME1, FIELDNAME2, ...

       A fields list (the word fields followed by comma-separated field names)
       is optional, but convenient.  It does two things:

       1. It  names  the  CSV field in each column.  This can be convenient if
          you are referencing them in other rules, so you can  say  %SomeField
          instead of remembering %13.

       2. Whenever  you  use one of the special hledger field names (described
          below), it assigns the CSV value in this position  to  that  hledger
          field.   This  is  the quickest way to populate hledger's fields and
          build a transaction.

       Here's an example that says "use the 1st, 2nd and  4th  fields  as  the
       transaction's  date,  description  and amount; name the last two fields
       for later reference; and ignore the others":

              fields date, description, , amount, , , somefield, anotherfield

       In a fields list, the separator is always comma; it is unrelated to the
       CSV file's separator.  Also:

       o There must be least two items in the list (at least one comma).

       o Field names may not contain spaces.  Spaces before/after field  names
         are optional.

       o Field names may contain _ (underscore) or - (hyphen).

       o Fields  you  don't  care  about can be given a dummy name or an empty
         name.

       If the CSV contains column headings, it's convenient to use  these  for
       your  field  names,  suitably  modified (eg lower-cased with spaces re-
       placed by underscores).

       Sometimes you may want to alter a CSV field name to avoid assigning  to
       a  hledger field with the same name.  Eg you could call the CSV's "bal-
       ance" field balance_ to avoid directly setting hledger's balance  field
       (and generating a balance assertion).

   Field assignment
              HLEDGERFIELD FIELDVALUE

       Field  assignments  are  the  more flexible way to assign CSV values to
       hledger fields.  They can be used instead of or in addition to a fields
       list (see above).

       To assign a value to a hledger field, write the field name (any of  the
       standard  hledger  field/pseudo-field  names,  defined below), a space,
       followed by a text value on the same line.  This text value may  inter-
       polate  CSV  fields, referenced either by their 1-based position in the
       CSV record (%N) or by the name they  were  given  in  the  fields  list
       (%CSVFIELD), and regular expression match groups (\N).

       Some examples:

              # set the amount to the 4th CSV field, with " USD" appended
              amount %4 USD

              # combine three fields to make a comment, containing note: and date: tags
              comment note: %somefield - %anotherfield, date: %1

       Tips:

       o Interpolation  strips outer whitespace (so a CSV value like " 1 " be-
         comes 1 when interpolated) (#1051).

       o Interpolations always refer to a CSV field - you can't interpolate  a
         hledger field.  (See Referencing other fields below).

   Field names
       Note  the  two  kinds  of  field names mentioned here, and used only in
       hledger CSV rules files:

       1. CSV field names (CSVFIELD in these docs): you  can  optionally  name
          the  CSV columns for easy reference (since hledger doesn't yet auto-
          matically recognise column headings in a CSV file), by writing arbi-
          trary names in a fields list, eg:

                  fields When, What, Some_Id, Net, Total, Foo, Bar

       2. Special hledger field names (HLEDGERFIELD in these docs):  you  must
          set  at least some of these to generate the hledger transaction from
          a CSV record, by writing them as the left hand side of a  field  as-
          signment, eg:

                  date        %When
                  code        %Some_Id
                  description %What
                  comment     %Foo %Bar
                  amount1     $ %Total

           or directly in a fields list:

                  fields date, description, code, , amount1, Foo, Bar
                  currency $
                  comment  %Foo %Bar

       Here  are  all the special hledger field names available, and what hap-
       pens when you assign values to them:

   date field
       Assigning to date sets the transaction date.

   date2 field
       date2 sets the transaction's secondary date, if any.

   status field
       status sets the transaction's status, if any.

   code field
       code sets the transaction's code, if any.

   description field
       description sets the transaction's description, if any.

   comment field
       comment sets the transaction's comment, if any.

       commentN, where N is a number, sets the Nth posting's comment.

       You can assign multi-line comments by writing literal \n in  the  code.
       A comment starting with \n will begin on a new line.

       Comments can contain tags, as usual.

       Posting comments can also contain a posting date.  A secondary date, or
       a year-less date, will be ignored.

   account field
       Assigning to accountN, where N is 1 to 99, sets the account name of the
       Nth posting, and causes that posting to be generated.

       Most  often  there are two postings, so you'll want to set account1 and
       account2.  Typically account1 is associated with the CSV file,  and  is
       set  once  with  a top-level assignment, while account2 is set based on
       each transaction's description, in conditional rules.

       If a posting's account name is left unset but its amount  is  set  (see
       below),  a default account name will be chosen (like "expenses:unknown"
       or "income:unknown").

   amount field
       There are several ways to set posting amounts from CSV, useful in  dif-
       ferent situations.

       1. amount  is  the  oldest  and  simplest.   Assigning to this sets the
          amount of the first and second postings.  In the second posting, the
          amount will be negated; also, if it has a cost attached, it will  be
          converted to cost.

       2. amount-in  and amount-out work exactly like the above, but should be
          used when the CSV  has  two  amount  fields  (such  as  "Debit"  and
          "Credit",  or  "Inflow"  and  "Outflow").   Whichever  field  has  a
          non-zero value will be used as the amount of the  first  and  second
          postings.  Here are some tips to avoid confusion:

           o It's  not "amount-in for posting 1 and amount-out for posting 2",
             it is "extract a single amount from the amount-in  or  amount-out
             field, and use that for posting 1 and (negated) for posting 2".

           o Don't  use both amount and amount-in/amount-out in the same rules
             file; choose based on whether the amount is in a single CSV field
             or spread across two fields.

           o In each record, at most one of the two CSV fields should  contain
             a  non-zero  amount; the other field must contain a zero or noth-
             ing.

           o hledger assumes both CSV fields contain unsigned numbers, and  it
             automatically negates the amount-out values.

           o If  the data doesn't fit these requirements, you'll probably need
             an if rule (see below).

       3. amountN (where N is a number from 1 to 99) sets the amount of only a
          single posting: the Nth posting in the transaction.  You'll  usually
          need  at  least two such assignments to make a balanced transaction.
          You can also generate more than two postings, to represent more com-
          plex transactions.  The posting numbers don't have  to  be  consecu-
          tive;  with if rules, higher posting numbers can be useful to ensure
          a certain order of postings.

       4. amountN-in and amountN-out work exactly like the above,  but  should
          be  used  when  the CSV has two amount fields.  This is analogous to
          amount-in and amount-out, and those tips also apply here.

       5. Remember that a fields list can also do assignments.  So in a fields
          list if you name a CSV field "amount", that counts as  assigning  to
          amount.   (If  you  don't  want  that, call it something else in the
          fields list, like "amount_".)

       6. The above don't handle every situation; if you need  more  flexibil-
          ity, use an if rule to set amounts conditionally.  See "Working with
          CSV  > Setting amounts" below for more on this and on amount-setting
          generally.

   currency field
       currency sets a currency symbol,  to  be  prepended  to  all  postings'
       amounts.   You  can  use this if the CSV amounts do not have a currency
       symbol, eg if it is in a separate column.

       currencyN prepends a currency symbol to just the Nth posting's amount.

   balance field
       balanceN sets a balance assertion amount (or if the posting  amount  is
       left empty, a balance assignment) on posting N.

       balance is a compatibility spelling for hledger <1.17; it is equivalent
       to balance1.

       You  can  adjust the type of assertion/assignment with the balance-type
       rule (see below).

       See the Working with CSV tips below for more about setting amounts  and
       currency.

   if block
       Rules  can  be  applied conditionally, depending on patterns in the CSV
       data.  This allows flexibility; in particular, it is how you can  cate-
       gorise  transactions,  selecting  an  appropriate account name based on
       their description (for example).  There are two ways  to  write  condi-
       tional  rules:  "if blocks", described here, and "if tables", described
       below.

       An if block is the word if and one or more "matcher"  expressions  (can
       be a word or phrase), one per line, starting either on the same or next
       line; followed by one or more indented rules.  Eg,

              if MATCHER
               RULE

       or

              if
              MATCHER
              MATCHER
              MATCHER
               RULE
               RULE

       If  any of the matchers succeeds, all of the indented rules will be ap-
       plied.  They are usually field assignments, but the  following  special
       rules may also be used within an if block:

       o skip  -  skips the matched CSV record (generating no transaction from
         it)

       o end - skips the rest of the current CSV file.

       Some examples:

              # if the record contains "groceries", set account2 to "expenses:groceries"
              if groceries
               account2 expenses:groceries

              # if the record contains any of these phrases, set account2 and a transaction comment as shown
              if
              monthly service fee
              atm transaction fee
              banking thru software
               account2 expenses:business:banking
               comment  XXX deductible ? check it

              # if an empty record is seen (assuming five fields), ignore the rest of the CSV file
              if ,,,,
               end

   Matchers
       There are two kinds of matcher:

       1. A whole record matcher is simplest: it is just a  word,  single-line
          text  fragment,  or other regular expression, which hledger will try
          to match case-insensitively anywhere within the CSV record.
       Eg: whole foods.

       2. A field matcher has a percent-prefixed CSV field number or name  be-
          fore the pattern.
       Eg: %3 whole foods or %description whole foods.
       hledger will try to match the pattern just within the named CSV field.

       When using these, there's two things to be aware of:

       1. Whole  record matchers don't see the exact original record; they see
          a reconstruction of it, in which  values  are  comma-separated,  and
          quotes  enclosing values and whitespace outside those quotes are re-
          moved.
       Eg when reading an SSV record like: 2023-01-01 ; "Acme, Inc. " ;  1,000
       the whole record matcher sees instead: 2023-01-01,Acme, Inc. ,1,000

       2. Field matchers expect either a CSV field number, or a CSV field name
          declared with fields.  (Don't use a hledger field name here,  unless
          it  is  also a CSV field name.)  A non-CSV field name will cause the
          matcher to match against "" (the empty string), and does  not  raise
          an  error,  allowing easier reuse of common rules with different CSV
          files.

       You can also prefix a matcher with ! (and optional space) to negate it.
       Eg ! whole foods, ! %3 whole  foods,  !%description  whole  foods  will
       match if "whole foods" is NOT present.  Added in 1.32.

       The  pattern  is, as usual in hledger, a POSIX extended regular expres-
       sion that also supports GNU word boundaries (\b, \B, \<, \>) and  noth-
       ing  else.   If  you have trouble with it, see "Regular expressions" in
       the  hledger  manual  (https://hledger.org/hledger.html#regular-expres-
       sions).

   Multiple matchers
       When an if block has multiple matchers, each on its own line,

       o By default they are OR'd (any of them can match).

       o Matcher  lines  beginning  with & (or &&, since 1.42) are AND'ed with
         the matcher above (all in the AND'ed group must match).

       o Matcher lines beginning with & ! (since 1.41, or &&  !,  since  1.42)
         are first negated and then AND'ed with the matcher above.

       You  can  also combine multiple matchers one the same line separated by
       && (AND) or && ! (AND NOT).  Eg %description amazon && %date 2025-01-01
       will match only when the description field contains  "amazon"  and  the
       date field contains "2025-01-01".  Added in 1.42.

   Match groups
       Added in 1.32

       Matchers can define match groups: parenthesised portions of the regular
       expression  which  are  available  for  reference in field assignments.
       Groups are enclosed in regular parentheses (( and )) and can be nested.
       Each group is available in field assignments using the token \N,  where
       N  is  an  index into the match groups for this conditional block (e.g.
       \1, \2, etc.).

       Example: Warp credit card payment postings  to  the  beginning  of  the
       billing period (Month start), to match how they are presented in state-
       ments, using posting dates:

              if %date (....-..)-..
                comment2 date:\1-01

       Another example: Read the expense account from the CSV field, but throw
       away a prefix:

              if %account1 liabilities:family:(expenses:.*)
                  account1 \1

   if table
       "if  tables"  are  an  alternative  to if blocks; they can express many
       matchers and field assignments in a more compact tabular  format,  like
       this:

              if,HLEDGERFIELD1,HLEDGERFIELD2,...
              MATCHERA,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
              MATCHERB && MATCHERC,VALUE1,VALUE2,...  (*since 1.42*)
              ; Comment line that explains MATCHERD
              MATCHERD,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
              <empty line>

       The first character after if is taken to be this if table's field sepa-
       rator.   It  is  unrelated  to  the separator used in the CSV file.  It
       should be a non-alphanumeric character like , or | that does not appear
       anywhere else in the table (it should not be used  in  field  names  or
       matchers or values, and it cannot be escaped with a backslash).

       Each  line must contain the same number of separators; empty values are
       allowed.  Whitespace can be used in the matcher lines  for  readability
       (but  not in the if line, currently).  You can use the comment lines in
       the table body.  The table must be terminated by an empty line (or  end
       of file).

       An  if  table  like the above is interpreted as follows: try all of the
       lines with matchers; whenever a line with matchers succeeds, assign all
       of the values on that line to the corresponding hledger fields; If mul-
       tiple lines match, later lines will override  fields  assigned  by  the
       earlier ones - just like the sequence of if blocks would behave.

       If table presented above is equivalent to this sequence of if blocks:

              if MATCHERA
                HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
                HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
                ...

              if MATCHERB && MATCHERC
                HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
                HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
                ...

              ; Comment line which explains MATCHERD
              if MATCHERD
                HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
                HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
                ...

       Example:

              if,account2,comment
              atm transaction fee,expenses:business:banking,deductible? check it
              %description groceries,expenses:groceries,
              ;; Comment line that desribes why this particular date is special
              2023/01/12.*Plumbing LLC,expenses:house:upkeep,emergency plumbing call-out

   balance-type
       Balance assertions generated by assigning to balanceN are of the simple
       =  type  by  default, which is a single-commodity, subaccount-excluding
       assertion.  You may find the subaccount-including variants more useful,
       eg if you have created some virtual subaccounts  of  checking  to  help
       with  budgeting.  You can select a different type of assertion with the
       balance-type rule:

              # balance assertions will consider all commodities and all subaccounts
              balance-type ==*

       Here are the balance assertion types for quick reference:

              =    single commodity, exclude subaccounts
              =*   single commodity, include subaccounts
              ==   multi commodity,  exclude subaccounts
              ==*  multi commodity,  include subaccounts

   include
              include RULESFILE

       This includes the contents of another CSV rules  file  at  this  point.
       RULESFILE  is  an  absolute file path or a path relative to the current
       file's directory.  This can be useful for sharing common rules  between
       several rules files, eg:

              # someaccount.csv.rules

              ## someaccount-specific rules
              fields   date,description,amount
              account1 assets:someaccount
              account2 expenses:misc

              ## common rules
              include categorisation.rules

   Working with CSV
       Some tips:

   Rapid feedback
       It's  a  good idea to get rapid feedback while creating/troubleshooting
       CSV rules.  Here's a good way, using entr from eradman.com/entrproject:

              $ ls foo.csv* | entr bash -c 'echo ----; hledger -f foo.csv print desc:SOMEDESC'

       A desc: query (eg) is used to select just one, or a  few,  transactions
       of  interest.   "bash  -c"  is used to run multiple commands, so we can
       echo a separator each time the command re-runs,  making  it  easier  to
       read the output.

   Valid CSV
       Note  that  hledger  will only accept valid CSV conforming to RFC 4180,
       and equivalent SSV and TSV formats (like RFC 4180 but with semicolon or
       tab as separators).  This means, eg:

       o Values may be enclosed in double quotes, or not.  Enclosing in single
         quotes is not allowed.  (Eg 'A','B' is rejected.)

       o When values are enclosed in double quotes, spaces outside the  quotes
         are not allowed.  (Eg "A", "B" is rejected.)

       o When  values  are not enclosed in quotes, they may not contain double
         quotes.  (Eg A"A, B is rejected.)

       If your CSV/SSV/TSV is not valid in this sense, you'll need  to  trans-
       form  it before reading with hledger.  Try using sed, or a more permis-
       sive CSV parser like python's csv lib.

   File Extension
       To help hledger choose the CSV file reader and  show  the  right  error
       messages  (and  choose the right field separator character by default),
       it's best if CSV/SSV/TSV files are named with  a  .csv,  .ssv  or  .tsv
       filename extension.  (More about this at Data formats.)

       When  reading  files with the "wrong" extension, you can ensure the CSV
       reader (and the default field separator) by  prefixing  the  file  path
       with csv:, ssv: or tsv:: Eg:

              $ hledger -f ssv:foo.dat print

       You can also override the default field separator with a separator rule
       if needed.

   Reading CSV from standard input
       You'll  need  the  file format prefix when reading CSV from stdin also,
       since hledger assumes journal format by default.  Eg:

              $ cat foo.dat | hledger -f ssv:- print

   Reading multiple CSV files
       If you use multiple -f options to read  multiple  CSV  files  at  once,
       hledger  will  look for a correspondingly-named rules file for each CSV
       file.  But if you specify a rules file with --rules,  that  rules  file
       will be used for all the CSV files.

   Reading files specified by rule
       Instead of specifying a CSV file in the command line, you can specify a
       rules  file,  as in hledger -f foo.csv.rules CMD.  By default this will
       read data from foo.csv in the same directory, but you can add a  source
       rule  to  specify  a  different  data file, perhaps located in your web
       browser's download directory.

       This feature was added in hledger 1.30, so you won't see it in most CSV
       rules examples.  But it helps remove some of the busywork  of  managing
       CSV downloads.  Most of your financial institutions's default CSV file-
       names  are  different  and can be recognised by a glob pattern.  So you
       can put a rule like source  Checking1*.csv  in  foo-checking.csv.rules,
       and then periodically follow a workflow like:

       1. Download CSV from Foo's website, using your browser's defaults

       2. Run hledger import foo-checking.csv.rules to import any new transac-
          tions

       After  import,  you can: discard the CSV, or leave it where it is for a
       while, or move it into your archives, as you prefer.  If you  do  noth-
       ing,  next  time your browser will save something like Checking1-2.csv,
       and hledger will use that because of the * wild card and because it  is
       the most recent.

   Valid transactions
       After reading a CSV file, hledger post-processes and validates the gen-
       erated journal entries as it would for a journal file - balancing them,
       applying  balance  assignments,  and canonicalising amount styles.  Any
       errors at this stage will be reported in the usual way, displaying  the
       problem entry.

       There is one exception: balance assertions, if you have generated them,
       will  not  be checked, since normally these will work only when the CSV
       data is part of the main journal.  If you do need to check balance  as-
       sertions generated from CSV right away, pipe into another hledger:

              $ hledger -f file.csv print | hledger -f- print

   Deduplicating, importing
       When  you  download a CSV file periodically, eg to get your latest bank
       transactions, the new file may overlap with  the  old  one,  containing
       some of the same records.

       The import command will (a) detect the new transactions, and (b) append
       just those transactions to your main journal.  It is idempotent, so you
       don't  have to remember how many times you ran it or with which version
       of the CSV.  (It keeps state in a hidden .latest.FILE.csv file.)   This
       is the easiest way to import CSV data.  Eg:

              # download the latest CSV files, then run this command.
              # Note, no -f flags needed here.
              $ hledger import *.csv [--dry]

       This  method  works  for  most CSV files.  (Where records have a stable
       chronological order, and new records appear only at the new end.)

       A number of other tools and workflows, hledger-specific and  otherwise,
       exist for converting, deduplicating, classifying and managing CSV data.

   Setting amounts
       Continuing  from amount field above, here are more tips for amount-set-
       ting:

       1. If the amount is in a single CSV field:
           a. If its sign indicates direction of flow:
           Assign it to amountN, to set the Nth posting's amount.  N  is  usu-
           ally 1 or 2 but can go up to 99.

           b. If another field indicates direction of flow:
           Use  one  or  more  conditional rules to set the appropriate amount
           sign.  Eg:

                  # assume a withdrawal unless Type contains "deposit":
                  amount1  -%Amount
                  if %Type deposit
                    amount1  %Amount

       2. If the amount is in two CSV fields (such as Debit and Credit, or  In
          and Out):
           a. If both fields are unsigned:
           Assign  one  field  to  amountN-in  and  the  other to amountN-out.
           hledger will automatically negate the "out"  field,  and  will  use
           whichever field value is non-zero as posting N's amount.

           b. If either field is signed:
           You  will  probably  need to override hledger's sign for one or the
           other field, as in the following example:

                  # Negate the -out value, but only if it is not empty:
                  fields date, description, amount1-in, amount1-out
                  if %amount1-out [1-9]
                   amount1-out -%amount1-out

           c. If both fields can contain a non-zero  value  (or  both  can  be
              empty):
           The   -in/-out   rules   normally   choose   the   value  which  is
           non-zero/non-empty.  Some value pairs can be ambiguous, such  as  1
           and none.  For such cases, use conditional rules to help select the
           amount.   Eg,  to  handle the above you could select the value con-
           taining non-zero digits:

                  fields date, description, in, out
                  if %in [1-9]
                   amount1 %in
                  if %out [1-9]
                   amount1 %out

       3. If you want posting 2's amount converted to cost:
       Use the unnumbered amount (or amount-in and amount-out) syntax.

       4. If the CSV has only balance amounts, not transaction amounts:
       Assign to balanceN, to set a balance assignment  on  the  Nth  posting,
       causing  the  posting's amount to be calculated automatically.  balance
       with no number is equivalent to balance1.  In this situation hledger is
       more likely to guess the wrong default account name, so you may need to
       set that explicitly.

   Amount signs
       There is some special handling making it easier to parse and to reverse
       amount signs.  (This only works for whole amounts, not for cost amounts
       such as COST in amount1  AMT @ COST):

       o If an amount value begins with a plus sign:
       that will be removed: +AMT becomes AMT

       o If an amount value is parenthesised:
       it will be de-parenthesised and sign-flipped: (AMT) becomes -AMT

       o If an amount value has two minus signs (or two sets  of  parentheses,
         or a minus sign and parentheses):
       they cancel out and will be removed: --AMT or -(AMT) becomes AMT

       o If  an  amount value contains just a sign (or just a set of parenthe-
         ses):
       that is removed, making it an empty value.  "+" or "-" or "()"  becomes
       "".

       It's  not  possible (without preprocessing the CSV) to set an amount to
       its absolute value, ie discard its sign.

   Setting currency/commodity
       If the currency/commodity  symbol  is  included  in  the  CSV's  amount
       field(s):

              2023-01-01,foo,$123.00

       you don't have to do anything special for the commodity symbol, it will
       be assigned as part of the amount.  Eg:

              fields date,description,amount

              2023-01-01 foo
                  expenses:unknown         $123.00
                  income:unknown          $-123.00

       If the currency is provided as a separate CSV field:

              2023-01-01,foo,USD,123.00

       You can assign that to the currency pseudo-field, which has the special
       effect  of prepending itself to every amount in the transaction (on the
       left, with no separating space):

              fields date,description,currency,amount

              2023-01-01 foo
                  expenses:unknown       USD123.00
                  income:unknown        USD-123.00

       Or, you can use a field assignment to construct  the  amount  yourself,
       with more control.  Eg to put the symbol on the right, and separated by
       a space:

              fields date,description,cur,amt
              amount %amt %cur

              2023-01-01 foo
                  expenses:unknown        123.00 USD
                  income:unknown         -123.00 USD

       Note  we  used a temporary field name (cur) that is not currency - that
       would trigger the prepending effect, which we don't want here.

   Amount decimal places
       When you are reading CSV data,  eg  with  a  command  like  hledger  -f
       foo.csv  print,  hledger  will infer each commodity's decimal precision
       (and other commodity display styles) from the amounts -  much  as  when
       reading a journal file without commodity directives (see the link).

       Note,  the  commodity  styles  are not inferred from the numbers in the
       original CSV data; rather, they are inferred from the amounts generated
       by the CSV rules.

       When you are importing CSV data with the import command, eg hledger im-
       port foo.csv, there's another step: import tries to make  the  new  en-
       tries  conform to the journal's existing styles.  So for each commodity
       - let's say it's EUR - import will choose:

       1. the style declared for EUR by a commodity directive in the journal

       2. otherwise, the style inferred from EUR amounts in the journal

       3. otherwise, the style inferred from EUR amounts generated by the  CSV
          rules.

       TLDR:  if  import  is not generating the precisions or styles you want,
       add a commodity directive to specify them.

   Referencing other fields
       In field assignments, you can interpolate only CSV fields, not  hledger
       fields.   In  the example below, there's both a CSV field and a hledger
       field named amount1, but %amount1 always means the CSV field,  not  the
       hledger field:

              # Name the third CSV field "amount1"
              fields date,description,amount1

              # Set hledger's amount1 to the CSV amount1 field followed by USD
              amount1 %amount1 USD

              # Set comment to the CSV amount1 (not the amount1 assigned above)
              comment %amount1

       Here,  since there's no CSV amount1 field, %amount1 will produce a lit-
       eral "amount1":

              fields date,description,csvamount
              amount1 %csvamount USD
              # Can't interpolate amount1 here
              comment %amount1

       When there are multiple field assignments to the  same  hledger  field,
       only the last one takes effect.  Here, comment's value will be be B, or
       C if "something" is matched, but never A:

              comment A
              comment B
              if something
               comment C

   How CSV rules are evaluated
       Here's how to think of CSV rules being evaluated.  If you get a confus-
       ing  error  while  reading a CSV file, it may help to try to understand
       which of these steps is failing:

       1. Any included rules files are inlined,  from  top  to  bottom,  depth
          first  (scanning  each  included  file  for further includes, recur-
          sively, before proceeding).

       2. Top level rules (date-format, fields, newest-first,  skip  etc)  are
          read, top to bottom.  "Top level rules" means non-conditional rules.
          If  a  rule  occurs  more  than  once, the last one wins; except for
          skip/end rules, where the first one wins.

       3. The CSV file is read as text.  Any non-ascii characters will be  de-
          coded using the text encoding specified by the encoding rule, other-
          wise the system locale's text encoding.

       4. Any  top-level  skip  or  end rule is applied.  skip [N] immediately
          skips the current or next N CSV records; end immediately  skips  all
          remaining CSV records (not normally used at top level).

       5. Now  any  remaining CSV records are processed.  For each CSV record,
          in file order:

           o Is there a conditional skip/end rule that applies for this record
             ?  Search the if blocks, from top to bottom, for a succeeding one
             containing a skip or end rule.  If found, skip the specified num-
             ber of CSV records, then continue at 5.
           Otherwise...

           o Do some basic validation on this CSV record (eg,  check  that  it
             has at least two fields).

           o For each hledger field (date, description, account1, etc.):

             1. Get  the field's assigned value, first searching top level as-
                signments, made directly or by the fields rule,  then  assign-
                ments  made  inside  succeeding  if blocks.  If there are more
                than one, the last one wins.

             2. Compute the field's actual value (as text),  by  interpolating
                any  %CSVFIELD  references  within  the  assigned value; or by
                choosing a default value if there was no assignment.

           o Generate a hledger transaction from  the  hledger  field  values,
             parsing them if needed (eg from text to an amount).

       This  is all done by the CSV reader, one of several readers hledger can
       use to read transactions from an input file.  When all input files have
       been read successfully, their  transactions  are  passed  to  whichever
       hledger command the user specified.

   Well factored rules
       Some  things  than  can help reduce duplication and complexity in rules
       files:

       o Extracting common rules usable with multiple CSV files  into  a  com-
         mon.rules, and adding include common.rules to each CSV's rules file.

       o Splitting if blocks into smaller if blocks, extracting the frequently
         used parts.

   CSV rules examples
   Bank of Ireland
       Here's  a  CSV with two amount fields (Debit and Credit), and a balance
       field, which we can use to add balance assertions, which is not  neces-
       sary but provides extra error checking:

              Date,Details,Debit,Credit,Balance
              07/12/2012,LODGMENT       529898,,10.0,131.21
              07/12/2012,PAYMENT,5,,126

              # bankofireland-checking.csv.rules

              # skip the header line
              skip

              # name the csv fields, and assign some of them as journal entry fields
              fields  date, description, amount-out, amount-in, balance

              # We generate balance assertions by assigning to "balance"
              # above, but you may sometimes need to remove these because:
              #
              # - the CSV balance differs from the true balance,
              #   by up to 0.0000000000005 in my experience
              #
              # - it is sometimes calculated based on non-chronological ordering,
              #   eg when multiple transactions clear on the same day

              # date is in UK/Ireland format
              date-format  %d/%m/%Y

              # set the currency
              currency  EUR

              # set the base account for all txns
              account1  assets:bank:boi:checking

              $ hledger -f bankofireland-checking.csv print
              2012-12-07 LODGMENT       529898
                  assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR10.0 = EUR131.2
                  income:unknown                  EUR-10.0

              2012-12-07 PAYMENT
                  assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR-5.0 = EUR126.0
                  expenses:unknown                  EUR5.0

       The  balance assertions don't raise an error above, because we're read-
       ing directly from CSV, but they will be checked if  these  entries  are
       imported into a journal file.

Timeclock
       The time logging format of timeclock.el, as read by hledger.

       hledger  can read time logs in timeclock format.  As with Ledger, these
       are (a  subset  of)  timeclock.el's  format,  containing  clock-in  and
       clock-out  entries as in the example below.  The date is a simple date.
       The time format is HH:MM[:SS][+-ZZZZ].  Seconds and  timezone  are  op-
       tional.   The  timezone, if present, must be four digits and is ignored
       (currently the time is always interpreted as a local time).  Lines  be-
       ginning with # or ; or *, and blank lines, are ignored.

              i 2015/03/30 09:00:00 some account  optional description after 2 spaces ; optional comment, tags:
              o 2015/03/30 09:20:00
              i 2015/03/31 22:21:45 another:account
              o 2015/04/01 02:00:34
              i 2015/04/02 12:00:00 another:account  ; this demonstrates multple sessions being clocked in
              i 2015/04/02 13:00:00 some account
              o 2015/04/02 14:00:00
              o 2015/04/02 15:00:00 another:account

       hledger  treats  each  clock-in/clock-out pair as a transaction posting
       some number of hours to an account.  Entries are paired by the  account
       name  if  the  same name is given for a clock-in/clock-out pair.  If no
       name is given for a clock-out, then it is paired with the  most  recent
       clock-in  entry.   If  the session spans more than one day, it is split
       into several transactions, one for each day.  For the above  time  log,
       hledger print generates these journal entries:

              $ hledger -f t.timeclock print
              2015-03-30 * optional description after 2 spaces   ; optional comment, tags:
                  (some account)           0.33h

              2015-03-31 * 22:21-23:59
                  (another:account)           1.64h

              2015-04-01 * 00:00-02:00
                  (another:account)           2.01h

              2015-04-02 * 12:00-15:00  ; this demonstrates multiple sessions being clocked in
                  (another:account)           3.00h

              2015-04-02 * 13:00-14:00
                  (some account)           1.00h

       Here is a sample.timeclock to download and some queries to try:

              $ hledger -f sample.timeclock balance                               # current time balances
              $ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p 2009/3                    # sessions in march 2009
              $ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p weekly --depth 1 --empty  # time summary by week

       To generate time logs, ie to clock in and clock out, you could:

       o use these shell aliases at the command line:

                alias ti='echo i `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` $* >>$TIMELOG'
                alias to='echo o `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` >>$TIMELOG'

       o or Emacs's built-in timeclock.el, or the extended timeclock-x.el, and
         perhaps the extras in ledgerutils.el

       o or use the old ti and to scripts in the ledger 2.x repository.  These
         rely  on  a "timeclock" executable which I think is just the ledger 2
         executable renamed.

Timedot
       timedot format is hledger's human-friendly time logging  format.   Com-
       pared  to  timeclock  format, it is more convenient for quick, approxi-
       mate, and retroactive time logging, and more  human-readable  (you  can
       see at a glance where time was spent).  A quick example:

              2023-05-01
              hom:errands          .... ....  ; two hours; the space is ignored
              fos:hledger:timedot  ..         ; half an hour
              per:admin:finance               ; no time spent yet

       hledger reads this as a transaction on this day with three (unbalanced)
       postings, where each dot represents "0.25".  No commodity symbol is as-
       sumed, but we typically interpret it as hours.

              $ hledger -f a.timedot print   # .timedot file extension (or timedot: prefix) is required
              2023-05-01 *
                  (hom:errands)                    2.00  ; two hours
                  (fos:hledger:timedot)            0.50  ; half an hour
                  (per:admin:finance)                 0

       A timedot file contains a series of transactions (usually one per day).
       Each  begins with a simple date (Y-M-D, Y/M/D, or Y.M.D), optionally be
       followed on the same line by a transaction description, and/or a trans-
       action comment following a semicolon.

       After the date line are zero or more time postings, consisting of:

       o An account name - any  hledger-style  account  name,  optionally  in-
         dented.

       o Two  or  more  spaces - required if there is an amount (as in journal
         format).

       o A timedot amount, which can be

         o empty (representing zero)

         o a number, optionally followed by a unit s, m, h, d, w,  mo,  or  y,
           representing  a  precise  number  of  seconds, minutes, hours, days
           weeks, months or years (hours is assumed by default), which will be
           converted to hours according to 60s = 1m, 60m = 1h, 24h = 1d, 7d  =
           1w, 30d = 1mo, 365d = 1y.

         o one  or  more  dots  (period  characters),  each representing 0.25.
           These are the dots in "timedot".  Spaces are  ignored  and  can  be
           used for grouping/alignment.

         o Added  in  1.32  one or more letters.  These are like dots but they
           also generate a tag t: (short for "type") with the  letter  as  its
           value,  and  a  separate posting for each of the values.  This pro-
           vides a second dimension of  categorisation,  viewable  in  reports
           with --pivot t.

       o An  optional  comment  following a semicolon (a hledger-style posting
         comment).

       There is some flexibility to help with keeping time log data and  notes
       in the same file:

       o Blank lines and lines beginning with # or ; are ignored.

       o After  the first date line, lines which do not contain a double space
         are parsed as postings with zero amount.  (hledger's register reports
         will show these if you add -E).

       o Before the first date line, lines beginning with * (eg org  headings)
         are  ignored.   And  from  the first date line onward, Emacs org mode
         heading prefixes at the start of lines (one or more *'s followed by a
         space) will be ignored.  This means the time log can also  be  a  org
         outline.

       Timedot files don't support directives like journal files.  So a common
       pattern  is to have a main journal file (eg time.journal) that contains
       any needed directives, and then  includes  the  timedot  file  (include
       time.timedot).

PART 3: REPORTING CONCEPTS
Time periods
   Report start & end date
       Most  hledger  reports will by default show the full time period repre-
       sented by the journal.  The report start  date  will  be  the  earliest
       transaction or posting date, and the report end date will be the latest
       transaction, posting, or market price date.

       Often you will want to see a shorter period, such as the current month.
       You  can specify a start and/or end date with the -b/--begin, -e/--end,
       or -p/--period options, or a date:  query  argument,  described  below.
       All of these accept the smart date syntax, also described below.

       End dates are exclusive; specify the day after the last day you want to
       see in the report.

       When dates are specified by multiple options, the last (right-most) op-
       tion  wins.   And when date: queries and date options are combined, the
       report period will be their intersection.

       Examples:

       -b 2016/3/17
              beginning on St.  Patrick's day 2016

       -e 12/1
              ending at the start of December 1st in the current year

       -p 'this month'
              during the current month

       -p thismonth
              same as above, spaces are optional

       -b 2023
              beginning on the first day of 2023

       date:2023.. or date:2023-
              same as above

       -b 2024 -e 2025 -p '2000 to 2030' date:2020-01 date:2020 :
       during January 2020 (the smallest common period, with the -p overriding
       -b and -e)

   Smart dates
       In hledger's user interfaces (though not in the journal file), you  can
       optionally  use  "smart  date" syntax.  Smart dates can be written with
       english words, can be relative, and can have  parts  omitted.   Missing
       parts  are  inferred as 1, when needed.  Smart dates can be interpreted
       as dates or periods depending on context.

       Examples:

       2004-01-01, 2004/10/1, 2004.9.1, 20240504 :
       Exact dates.  The year must have at least four digits, the  month  must
       be  1-12,  the  day  must  be 1-31, the separator can be - or / or . or
       nothing.

       2004-10
              start of month

       2004   start of year

       10/1 or oct or october
              October 1st in current year

       21     21st day in current month

       yesterday, today, tomorrow
              -1, 0, 1 days from today

       last/this/next day/week/month/quarter/year
              -1, 0, 1 periods from the current period

       in n days/weeks/months/quarters/years
              n periods from the current period

       n days/weeks/months/quarters/years ahead
              n periods from the current period

       n days/weeks/months/quarters/years ago
              -n periods from the current period

       20181201
              8 digit YYYYMMDD with valid year month and day

       201812 6 digit YYYYMM with valid year and month

       Dates with no separators are allowed but might give surprising  results
       if mistyped:

       o 20181301 (YYYYMMDD with an invalid month) is parsed as an eight-digit
         year

       o 20181232 (YYYYMMDD with an invalid day) gives a parse error

       o 201801012  (a  valid  YYYYMMDD followed by additional digits) gives a
         parse error

       The meaning of relative dates depends on today's date.  If you need  to
       test  or reproduce old reports, you can use the --today option to over-
       ride that.  (Except for periodic transaction rules, which are  not  af-
       fected by --today.)

   Report intervals
       A  report interval can be specified so that reports like register, bal-
       ance or activity become multi-period, showing each subperiod as a sepa-
       rate row or column.

       The following standard  intervals  can  be  enabled  with  command-line
       flags:

       o -D/--daily

       o -W/--weekly

       o -M/--monthly

       o -Q/--quarterly

       o -Y/--yearly

       More  complex  intervals  can be specified using -p/--period, described
       below.

   Date adjustments
   Start date adjustment
       If you let hledger infer a report's start date, it will adjust the date
       to the previous natural boundary of the report interval, for convenient
       periodic reports.  (If you don't want that, specify a start date.)

       For example, if the journal's first transaction is on january 10th,

       o hledger register (no report interval) will start the report on  janu-
         ary 10th.

       o hledger  register  --monthly  will  start  the report on the previous
         month boundary, january 1st.

       o hledger register --monthly --begin 1/5 will start the report on janu-
         ary 5th [1].

       Also if you are generating transactions or budget goals  with  periodic
       transaction  rules,  their  start date may be adjusted in a similar way
       (in certain situations).

   End date adjustment
       A report's end date is always adjusted to include a whole number of in-
       tervals, so that the last subperiod has the same length as the others.

       For example, if the journal's last transaction is on february 20th,

       o hledger register will end the report on february 20th.

       o hledger register --monthly will end the report at the end  of  febru-
         ary.

       o hledger register --monthly --end 2/14 also will end the report at the
         end of february.

       o hledger register --monthly --begin 1/5 --end 2/14 will end the report
         on march 4th [1].

       [1] Since hledger 1.29.

   Period headings
       With  non-standard  subperiods,  hledger will show "STARTDATE..ENDDATE"
       headings.  With standard subperiods (ie, starting on a natural interval
       boundary), you'll see more compact headings, which are usually  prefer-
       able.  (Though month names will be in english, currently.)

       So  if  you  are specifying a start date and you want compact headings:
       choose a start of year for yearly reports, a start of quarter for quar-
       terly reports, a start of month for monthly reports,  etc.   (Remember,
       you  can  write eg -b 2024 or 1/1 as a shortcut for a start of year, or
       2024-04 or 202404 or Apr for a start of month or quarter.)

       For weekly reports, choose a date that's a Monday.  (You can  try  dif-
       ferent  dates until you see the short headings, or write eg -b '3 weeks
       ago'.)

   Period expressions
       The -p/--period option specifies a period expression, which is  a  com-
       pact way of expressing a start date, end date, and/or report interval.

       Here's  a  period  expression with a start and end date (specifying the
       first quarter of 2009):

       -p "from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"

       Several keywords like "from" and "to" are  supported  for  readability;
       these  are  optional.   "to"  can  also be written as ".." or "-".  The
       spaces are also optional, as long as you don't run two dates  together.
       So the following are equivalent to the above:

       -p "2009/1/1 2009/4/1"
       -p2009/1/1to2009/4/1
       -p2009/1/1..2009/4/1

       Dates  are  smart dates, so if the current year is 2009, these are also
       equivalent to the above:

       -p "1/1 4/1"
       -p "jan-apr"
       -p "this year to 4/1"

       If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be the
       earliest or latest transaction date in the journal:

       -p "from 2009/1/1"   everything  after  january
                            1, 2009
       -p "since 2009/1"    the  same, since is a syn-
                            onym
       -p "from 2009"       the same
       -p "to 2009"         everything before  january
                            1, 2009

       You can also specify a period by writing a single partial or full date:

       -p "2009"        the year 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2010/1/1"
       -p "2009/1"      the  month  of january 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to
                        2009/2/1"
       -p "2009/1/1"    the first day  of  2009;  equivalent  to  "2009/1/1  to
                        2009/1/2"

       or by using the "Q" quarter-year syntax (case insensitive):

       -p "2009Q1"       first  quarter  of  2009,  equivalent  to  "2009/1/1 to
                         2009/4/1"
       -p "q4"           fourth quarter of the current year

   Period expressions with a report interval
       A period expression can also begin with a  report  interval,  separated
       from the start/end dates (if any) by a space or the word in:

       -p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"
       -p "monthly in 2008"
       -p "quarterly"

   More complex report intervals
       Some more complex intervals can be specified within period expressions,
       such as:

       o biweekly (every two weeks)

       o fortnightly

       o bimonthly (every two months)

       o every day|week|month|quarter|year

       o every N days|weeks|months|quarters|years

       Weekly on a custom day:

       o every  Nth  day of week (th, nd, rd, or st are all accepted after the
         number)

       o every WEEKDAYNAME (full or three-letter english  weekday  name,  case
         insensitive)

       Monthly on a custom day:

       o every  Nth  day [of month] (31st day will be adjusted to each month's
         last day)

       o every Nth WEEKDAYNAME [of month]

       Yearly on a custom month and day:

       o every MM/DD [of year] (month number and day of month number)

       o every MONTHNAME DDth [of year] (full or  three-letter  english  month
         name, case insensitive, and day of month number)

       o every DDth MONTHNAME [of year] (equivalent to the above)

       Examples:

       -p "bimonthly from 2008"
       -p "every 2 weeks"
       -p  "every  5  months  from
       2009/03"
       -p "every 2nd day of week"    periods will go from Tue to Tue
       -p "every Tue"                same
       -p "every 15th day"           period boundaries will be on 15th  of  each
                                     month
       -p "every 2nd Monday"         period  boundaries will be on second Monday
                                     of each month
       -p "every 11/05"              yearly periods with boundaries  on  5th  of
                                     November
       -p "every 5th November"       same
       -p "every Nov 5th"            same

       Show  historical balances at end of the 15th day of each month (N is an
       end date, exclusive as always):

              $ hledger balance -H -p "every 16th day"

       Group postings from the start of wednesday  to  end  of  the  following
       tuesday (N is both (inclusive) start date and (exclusive) end date):

              $ hledger register checking -p "every 3rd day of week"

   Multiple weekday intervals
       This special form is also supported:

       o every WEEKDAYNAME,WEEKDAYNAME,... (full or three-letter english week-
         day names, case insensitive)

       Also,  weekday and weekendday are shorthand for mon,tue,wed,thu,fri and
       sat,sun.

       This is mainly intended for use with --forecast, to  generate  periodic
       transactions on arbitrary days of the week.  It may be less useful with
       -p, since it divides each week into subperiods of unequal length, which
       is unusual.  (Related: #1632)

       Examples:

       -p          "every   dates  will  be  Mon,  Wed,  Fri;  periods  will  be
       mon,wed,fri"         Mon-Tue, Wed-Thu, Fri-Sun
       -p "every weekday"   dates  will be Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri; periods will
                            be Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri-Sun
       -p "every weekend-   dates will be Sat, Sun; periods will be Sat, Sun-Fri
       day"

Depth
       With the --depth NUM option (short form: -NUM), reports will  show  ac-
       counts  only  to  the  specified depth, hiding deeper subaccounts.  Use
       this when you want a summary with less detail.  This flag has the  same
       effect as a depth: query argument: depth:2, --depth=2 or -2 are equiva-
       lent.

       In  place  of  a single number which limits the depth for all accounts,
       you can also provide separate depth limits for different accounts using
       regular expressions (since 1.41).

       For example, --depth assets=2 (or, equivalently:  depth:assets=2)  will
       collapse  accounts  matching  the regular expression assets to depth 2.
       So assets:bank:savings would be collapsed to assets:bank, while liabil-
       ities:bank:credit card would not be affected.   This  can  be  combined
       with  a  flat depth to collapse other accounts not matching the regular
       expression,  so  --depth  assets=2  --depth  1   would   collapse   as-
       sets:bank:savings  to  assets:bank  and liabilities:bank:credit card to
       liabilities.

       You can supply multiple depth arguments and they will all  be  applied,
       so --depth assets=2 --depth liabilities=3 --depth 1 would collapse:

       o accounts matching assets to depth 2,

       o accounts matching liabilities to depth 3,

       o all other accounts to depth 1.

       If  an account is matched by more than one regular expression depth ar-
       gument then the more specific one will used.  For example,  if  --depth
       assets=1   --depth   assets:bank:savings=2   is   provided,   then  as-
       sets:bank:savings will be collapsed to depth 2  rather  than  depth  1.
       This  is  because assets:bank:savings matches at level 3 in the account
       name, while assets matches at level 1.  The same would be true with the
       argument --depth assets=1 --depth savings=2.

Queries
       Many hledger commands accept  query  arguments,  which  restrict  their
       scope  and  let  you report on a precise subset of your data.  Here's a
       quick overview of hledger's queries:

       o By default, a query argument is treated as  a  case-insensitive  sub-
         string pattern for matching account names.  Eg:

         dining groceries
         car:fuel
       o Patterns  containing  spaces  or other special characters must be en-
         closed in single or double quotes:

         'personal care'
       o Patterns are actually regular expressions,  so  you  can  add  regexp
         metacharacters  for  more precision (or you may need to backslash-es-
         cape certain characters; see "Regular expressions" above):

         '^expenses\b'
         'food$'
         'fuel|repair'
         'accounts (payable|receivable)'
       o To match something other than the account name, you can add  a  query
         type prefix, such as:

         date:202312-
         status:
         desc:amazon
         cur:USD
         cur:\\$
         amt:'>0'
         acct:groceries  (but acct: is the default, so we usually don't bother
         writing it)
       o To negate a query, add a not: prefix:

         not:status:'*'
         not:desc:'opening|closing'
         not:cur:USD
       o Multiple query terms can be combined, as space-separated queries  Eg:
         hledger  print  date:2022  desc:amazon  desc:amzn  (show transactions
         dated in 2022 whose description contains "amazon" or "amzn").
       o Or  more  flexibly   as   boolean   queries.    Eg:   hledger   print
         expr:'date:2022 and (desc:amazon or desc:amzn) and not date:202210'
       All  hledger  commands  use the same query language, but different com-
       mands may interpret the query in different ways.  We haven't  described
       the  commands  yet (that's coming in PART 4: COMMANDS below) but here's
       the gist of it:

       o Transaction-oriented commands (print, aregister, close,  import,  de-
         scriptions..)  try to match transactions (including the transaction's
         postings).

       o Posting-oriented  commands (register, balance, balancesheet, incomes-
         tatement, accounts..)  try to match postings.  Postings inherit their
         transaction's attributes for querying purposes, so transaction fields
         like date or description can still be referenced in a posting query.

       o A few commands match in more specific ways.  (Eg aregister, which has
         a special first argument.)

   Query types
       Here are the query types available:

   acct: query
       acct:REGEX, or just REGEX
       Match account names containing this case  insensitive  regular  expres-
       sion.
       This  is the default query type, so we usually don't bother writing the
       "acct:" prefix.

   amt: query
       amt:N, amt:'<N', amt:'<=N', amt:'>N', amt:'>=N'
       Match postings with a single-commodity amount equal to, less  than,  or
       greater  than  N. (Postings with multi-commodity amounts are not tested
       and  will  always  match.)   amt:  needs  quotes  to  hide   the   less
       than/greater than sign from the command line shell.

       The  comparison has two modes: if N is preceded by a + or - sign (or is
       0), the two signed numbers are compared.  Otherwise, the absolute  mag-
       nitudes are compared, ignoring sign.

       Keep in mind that amt: matches posting amounts, not account balances.

   code: query
       code:REGEX
       Match by transaction code (eg check number).

   cur: query
       cur:REGEX
       Match  postings  or  transactions  including  any  amounts  whose  cur-
       rency/commodity  symbol  is  fully  matched  by  REGEX.   (Contrary  to
       hledger's   usual   infix   matching.   To  do  infix  matching,  write
       .*REGEX.*.)  Note, to match special characters which are regex-signifi-
       cant, you need to escape them with \.  And  for  characters  which  are
       significant  to  your shell you will usually need one more level of es-
       caping.  Eg to match the dollar sign: cur:\\$ or cur:'\$'

   desc: query
       desc:REGEX
       Match transaction descriptions.

   date: query
       date:PERIODEXPR
       Match dates (or with the --date2  flag,  secondary  dates)  within  the
       specified period.  PERIODEXPR is a period expression with no report in-
       terval.  Examples:
       date:2016, date:thismonth, date:2/1-2/15, date:2021-07-27..nextquarter.

   date2: query
       date2:PERIODEXPR
       If  you  use  secondary  dates: this matches secondary dates within the
       specified period.  It is not affected by the --date2 flag.

   depth: query
       depth:[REGEXP=]N
       Match (or display, depending on command)  accounts  at  or  above  this
       depth, optionally only for accounts matching a provided regular expres-
       sion.  See Depth for detailed rules.

   note: query
       note:REGEX
       Match transaction notes (the part of the description right of |, or the
       whole description if there's no |).

   payee: query
       payee:REGEX
       Match  transaction  payee/payer names (the part of the description left
       of |, or the whole description if there's no |).

   real: query
       real:, real:0
       Match real or virtual postings respectively.

   status: query
       status:, status:!, status:*
       Match unmarked, pending, or cleared transactions respectively.

   type: query
       type:TYPECODES
       Match by account type (see Declaring accounts > Account types).   TYPE-
       CODES  is  one or more of the single-letter account type codes ALERXCV,
       case insensitive.  Note type:A and type:E will also match their respec-
       tive subtypes C (Cash) and V (Conversion).  Certain  kinds  of  account
       alias  can  disrupt account types, see Rewriting accounts > Aliases and
       account types.

   tag: query
       tag:NAMEREGEX[=VALREGEX]
       Match by tag name, and optionally also by tag value.  Note:

       o Both regular expressions do infix matching.  If you need  a  complete
         match, use ^ and $.
       Eg: tag:'^fullname$', tag:'^fullname$=^fullvalue$

       o To match values, ignoring names, do tag:.=VALREGEX

       o Accounts also inherit the tags of their parent accounts.

       o Postings also inherit the tags of their account and their transaction
         .

       o Transactions also acquire the tags of their postings.

   Negative queries
   not: query
       not:QUERY
       You can prepend not: to a query to negate the match.
       Eg: not:equity, not:desc:apple
       (Also,  a  trick: not:not:... can sometimes solve query problems conve-
       niently.)

   Space-separated queries
       When given multiple space-separated query terms, most  commands  select
       things which match:

       o any of the description terms AND

       o any of the account terms AND

       o any of the status terms AND

       o all the other terms.

       The print command is a little different, showing transactions which:

       o match any of the description terms AND

       o have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND

       o have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND

       o match all the other terms.

   Boolean queries
       You can write more complicated "boolean" query expressions, enclosed in
       quotes and prefixed with expr:.  These can combine subqueries with NOT,
       AND,  OR  operators  (case  insensitive), and parentheses for grouping.
       Eg, to show transactions involving both cash and expense accounts:

              hledger print expr:'cash AND expenses'

       The prefix and enclosing quotes are required, so  don't  write  hledger
       print cash AND expenses.  That would be a space-separated query showing
       transactions  involving  accounts with any of "cash", "and", "expenses"
       in their names.

       You can write space-separated queries inside a boolean query, and  they
       will  combine  as  described  above, but it might be confusing and best
       avoided.  Eg these are equivalent, showing transactions involving  cash
       or expenses accounts:

              hledger print expr:'cash expenses'
              hledger print cash expenses

       There  is a restriction with date: queries: they may not be used inside
       OR expressions.

       Actually, there are three types of boolean  query:  expr:  for  general
       use, and any: and all: variants which can be useful with print.

   expr: query
       expr:'QUERYEXPR'
       For  example, expr:'date:lastmonth AND NOT (food OR rent)' means "match
       things which are dated in the last month and do not have food  or  rent
       in the account name".

       When  using  expr: with transaction-oriented commands like print, post-
       ing-oriented query terms like acct: and amt: are  considered  to  match
       the transaction if they match any of its postings.
       So,  hledger print expr:'cash and amt:>0' means "show transactions with
       (at least one posting involving a cash account) and (at least one post-
       ing with a positive amount)".

   any: query
       any:'QUERYEXPR'
       Like expr:, but  when  used  with  transaction-oriented  commands  like
       print,  it  matches the transaction only if a posting can be matched by
       all of QUERYEXPR.
       So, hledger print any:'cash and amt:>0' means "show transactions  where
       at least one posting posts a positive amount to a cash account".

   all: query
       all:'QUERYEXPR'
       Like  expr:,  but  when  used  with  transaction-oriented commands like
       print, it matches the transaction only if all postings are  matched  by
       all of QUERYEXPR.
       So,  hledger  print all:'cash and amt:0' means "show transactions where
       all postings involve a cash account and have a zero amount".
       Or, hledger print all:'cash or checking' means "show transactions which
       touch only cash and/or checking accounts".

   Queries and command options
       Some queries can also be expressed as command-line options: depth:2  is
       equivalent to --depth 2, date:2023 is equivalent to -p 2023, etc.  When
       you  mix  command  options and query arguments, generally the resulting
       query is their intersection.

   Queries and account aliases
       When account names are rewritten with  --alias  or  alias,  acct:  will
       match either the old or the new account name.

   Queries and valuation
       When  amounts  are  converted to other commodities in cost or value re-
       ports, cur: and amt: match the old commodity symbol and the old  amount
       quantity, not the new ones.  (Except in hledger 1.22, #1625.)

Pivoting
       Normally,  hledger  groups amounts and displays their totals by account
       (name).  With  --pivot  PIVOTEXPR,  some  other  field's  (or  multiple
       fields')  value  is used as a synthetic account name, causing different
       grouping and display.  PIVOTEXPR can be

       o any of these standard transaction or posting fields (their  value  is
         substituted):  status,  code, desc, payee, note, acct, comm/cur, amt,
         cost

       o or a tag name

       o or any combination of these, colon-separated.

       Some special cases:

       o Colons appearing in PIVOTEXPR or in a pivoted tag value will generate
         account hierarchy.

       o When pivoting a posting has multiple values for a  tag,  the  pivoted
         value of that tag will be the first value.

       o When  a  posting  has  multiple  commodities,  the  pivoted  value of
         "comm"/"cur" will be "".  Also when an unrecognised tag name or field
         is provided, its pivoted value will be "".  (If this causes confusing
         output, consider excluding those postings from the report.)

       Examples:

              2016/02/16 Yearly Dues Payment
                  assets:bank account                 2 EUR
                  income:dues                        -2 EUR  ; member: John Doe, kind: Lifetime

       Normal balance report showing account names:

              $ hledger balance
                             2 EUR  assets:bank account
                            -2 EUR  income:dues
              --------------------
                                 0

       Pivoted balance report, using member: tag values instead:

              $ hledger balance --pivot member
                             2 EUR
                            -2 EUR  John Doe
              --------------------
                                 0

       One way to show only amounts with a member: value (using a query):

              $ hledger balance --pivot member tag:member=.
                            -2 EUR  John Doe
              --------------------
                            -2 EUR

       Another way (the acct:  query  matches  against  the  pivoted  "account
       name"):

              $ hledger balance --pivot member acct:.
                            -2 EUR  John Doe
              --------------------
                            -2 EUR

       Hierarchical reports can be generated with multiple pivot values:

              $ hledger balance Income:Dues --pivot kind:member
                            -2 EUR  Lifetime:John Doe
              --------------------
                            -2 EUR

Generating data
       hledger  can enrich the data provided to it, or generate new data, in a
       number of ways.  Mostly, this is done only if you request it:

       o Missing amounts or missing costs in transactions are  inferred  auto-
         matically when possible.

       o The  --infer-equity  flag  infers  missing conversion equity postings
         from @/@@ costs.

       o The --infer-costs flag infers missing costs  from  conversion  equity
         postings.

       o The --infer-market-prices flag infers P price directives from costs.

       o The  --auto  flag adds extra postings to transactions matched by auto
         posting rules.

       o The --forecast option generates transactions from  periodic  transac-
         tion rules.

       o The  balance --budget report infers budget goals from periodic trans-
         action rules.

       o Commands like close, rewrite, and hledger-interest generate  transac-
         tions or postings.

       o CSV  data  is  converted  to  transactions by applying CSV conversion
         rules..  etc.

       Such generated data is temporary, existing only at  report  time.   You
       can  convert it to permanent recorded data by, eg, capturing the output
       of hledger print and saving it in your journal file.   This  can  some-
       times be useful as a data entry aid.

       If  you  are  curious what data is being generated and why, run hledger
       print -x --verbose-tags.   -x/--explicit  shows  inferred  amounts  and
       --verbose-tags  adds  tags  like  generated-transaction  (from periodic
       rules) and generated-posting, modified (from auto posting rules).  Sim-
       ilar hidden tags (with an underscore prefix) are always present,  also,
       so  you  can  always match such data with queries like tag:generated or
       tag:modified.

Forecasting
       Forecasting, or speculative future reporting, can be useful  for  esti-
       mating future balances, or for exploring different future scenarios.

       The simplest and most flexible way to do it with hledger is to manually
       record a bunch of future-dated transactions.  You could keep these in a
       separate  future.journal and include that with -f only when you want to
       see them.

   --forecast
       There is another way: with the --forecast option, hledger can  generate
       temporary  "forecast transactions" for reporting purposes, according to
       periodic transaction rules defined in the journal.  Each rule can  gen-
       erate  multiple recurring transactions, so by changing one rule you can
       change many forecasted transactions.

       Forecast transactions usually start after  ordinary  transactions  end.
       By default, they begin after your latest-dated ordinary transaction, or
       today,  whichever  is  later, and they end six months from today.  (The
       exact rules are a little more complicated, and are given below.)

       This is the "forecast period", which need not be the same as the report
       period.  You can override it - eg to forecast farther into the  future,
       or to force forecast transactions to overlap your ordinary transactions
       -  by  giving  the --forecast option a period expression argument, like
       --forecast=..2099 or --forecast=2023-02-15...  Note that the =  is  re-
       quired.

   Inspecting forecast transactions
       print  is  the best command for inspecting and troubleshooting forecast
       transactions.  Eg:

              ~ monthly from 2022-12-20    rent
                  assets:bank:checking
                  expenses:rent           $1000

              $ hledger print --forecast --today=2023/4/21
              2023-05-20 rent
                  ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
                  assets:bank:checking
                  expenses:rent                  $1000

              2023-06-20 rent
                  ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
                  assets:bank:checking
                  expenses:rent                  $1000

              2023-07-20 rent
                  ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
                  assets:bank:checking
                  expenses:rent                  $1000

              2023-08-20 rent
                  ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
                  assets:bank:checking
                  expenses:rent                  $1000

              2023-09-20 rent
                  ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
                  assets:bank:checking
                  expenses:rent                  $1000

       Here there are no ordinary transactions, so the forecasted transactions
       begin on the first occurrence after today's date.  (You won't  normally
       use --today; it's just to make these examples reproducible.)

   Forecast reports
       Forecast transactions affect all reports, as you would expect.  Eg:

              $ hledger areg rent --forecast --today=2023/4/21
              Transactions in expenses:rent and subaccounts:
              2023-05-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $1000
              2023-06-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $2000
              2023-07-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $3000
              2023-08-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $4000
              2023-09-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $5000

              $ hledger bal -M expenses --forecast --today=2023/4/21
              Balance changes in 2023-05-01..2023-09-30:

                             ||   May    Jun    Jul    Aug    Sep
              ===============++===================================
               expenses:rent || $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000
              ---------------++-----------------------------------
                             || $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000

   Forecast tags
       Forecast  transactions generated by --forecast have a hidden tag, _gen-
       erated-transaction.  So if you ever need  to  match  forecast  transac-
       tions, you could use tag:_generated-transaction (or just tag:generated)
       in a query.

       For  troubleshooting, you can add the --verbose-tags flag.  Then, visi-
       ble generated-transaction tags will be added also, so you can view them
       with the print command.  Their value indicates which periodic rule  was
       responsible.

   Forecast period, in detail
       Forecast start/end dates are chosen so as to do something useful by de-
       fault  in  almost  all situations, while also being flexible.  Here are
       (with luck) the exact rules, to help with troubleshooting:

       The forecast period starts on:

       o the later of

         o the start date in the periodic transaction rule

         o the start date in --forecast's argument

       o otherwise (if those are not available): the later of

         o the report start date specified with -b/-p/date:

         o the day after the latest ordinary transaction in the journal

       o otherwise (if none of these are available): today.

       The forecast period ends on:

       o the earlier of

         o the end date in the periodic transaction rule

         o the end date in --forecast's argument

       o otherwise: the report end date specified with -e/-p/date:

       o otherwise: 180 days (~6 months) from today.

   Forecast troubleshooting
       When --forecast is not doing what you expect, one of these tips  should
       help:

       o Remember to use the --forecast option.

       o Remember to have at least one periodic transaction rule in your jour-
         nal.

       o Test with print --forecast.

       o Check  for  typos or too-restrictive start/end dates in your periodic
         transaction rule.

       o Leave at least 2 spaces between the rule's period expression and  de-
         scription fields.

       o Check  for  future-dated ordinary transactions suppressing forecasted
         transactions.

       o Try setting explicit report start and/or end dates with -b, -e, -p or
         date:

       o Try adding the -E flag to encourage  display  of  empty  periods/zero
         transactions.

       o Try  setting  explicit  forecast  start and/or end dates with --fore-
         cast=START..END

       o Consult Forecast period, in detail, above.

       o Check inside the engine: add --debug=2 (eg).

Budgeting
       With the balance command's --budget report, each  periodic  transaction
       rule  generates recurring budget goals in specified accounts, and goals
       and actual performance can be compared.  See the balance command's  doc
       below.

       You  can  generate  budget  goals and forecast transactions at the same
       time, from the same or different periodic  transaction  rules:  hledger
       bal -M --budget --forecast ...

       See also: Budgeting and Forecasting.

Amount formatting
   Commodity display style
       For the amounts in each commodity, hledger chooses a consistent display
       style  (symbol placement, decimal mark and digit group marks, number of
       decimal digits) to use in most reports.  This is inferred as follows:

       First, if there's a D directive declaring  a  default  commodity,  that
       commodity  symbol and amount format is applied to all no-symbol amounts
       in the journal.

       Then each commodity's display style is determined  from  its  commodity
       directive.   We  recommend  always declaring commodities with commodity
       directives, since they help ensure consistent display styles and preci-
       sions, and bring other benefits such as error  checking  for  commodity
       symbols.  Here's an example:

              # Set display styles (and decimal marks, for parsing, if there is no decimal-mark directive)
              # for the $, EUR, INR and no-symbol commodities:
              commodity $1,000.00
              commodity EUR 1.000,00
              commodity INR 9,99,99,999.00
              commodity 1 000 000.9455

       But  for  convenience, if a commodity directive is not present, hledger
       infers a commodity's display styles from its amounts as they are  writ-
       ten  in  the  journal  (excluding  cost amounts and amounts in periodic
       transaction rules or auto posting rules).  It uses

       o the symbol placement and decimal mark of the first amount seen

       o the digit group marks of the first amount with digit group marks

       o and the maximum number of decimal digits seen across all amounts.

       And as fallback if no applicable amounts are found, it would use a  de-
       fault style, like $1000.00 (symbol on the left with no space, period as
       decimal mark, and two decimal digits).

       Finally, commodity styles can be overridden by the -c/--commodity-style
       command line option.

   Rounding
       Amounts are stored internally as decimal numbers with up to 255 decimal
       places.   They  are displayed with their original journal precisions by
       print and print-like reports, and rounded to  their  display  precision
       (the number of decimal digits specified by the commodity display style)
       by  other  reports.   When rounding, hledger uses banker's rounding (it
       rounds to the nearest even digit).  So eg 0.5 displayed with zero deci-
       mal digits appears as "0".

   Trailing decimal marks
       If you're wondering why your print report sometimes shows trailing dec-
       imal marks, with no decimal digits; it does this when  showing  amounts
       that have digit group marks but no decimal digits, to disambiguate them
       and allow them to be re-parsed reliably (see Decimal marks).  Eg:

              commodity $1,000.00

              2023-01-02
                  (a)      $1000

              $ hledger print
              2023-01-02
                  (a)        $1,000.

       If this is a problem (eg when exporting to Ledger), you can avoid it by
       disabling  digit group marks, eg with -c/--commodity (for each affected
       commodity):

              $ hledger print -c '$1000.00'
              2023-01-02
                  (a)          $1000

       or by forcing print to always show decimal digits, with --round:

              $ hledger print -c '$1,000.00' --round=soft
              2023-01-02
                  (a)      $1,000.00

   Amount parseability
       More generally, hledger output falls into three rough categories, which
       format amounts a little bit differently to suit different consumers:

       1.  "hledger-readable output" - should be readable by hledger  (and  by
       humans)

       o This  is  produced  by reports that show full journal entries: print,
         import, close, rewrite etc.

       o It shows amounts with their original journal  precisions,  which  may
         not be consistent from one amount to the next.

       o It  adds a trailing decimal mark when needed to avoid showing ambigu-
         ous amounts.

       o It can be parsed reliably (by hledger and ledger2beancount at  least,
         but perhaps not by Ledger..)

       2.  "human-readable output" - usually for humans

       o This is produced by all other reports.

       o It shows amounts with standard display precisions, which will be con-
         sistent within each commodity.

       o It shows ambiguous amounts unmodified.

       o It  can be parsed reliably in the context of a known report (when you
         know decimals are consistently not being shown, you can assume a sin-
         gle mark is a digit group mark).

       3.  "machine-readable output" - usually for other software

       o This is produced by all reports when an output format like csv,  tsv,
         json, or sql is selected.

       o It shows amounts as 1 or 2 do, but without digit group marks.

       o It can be parsed reliably (if needed, the decimal mark can be changed
         with -c/--commodity-style).

Cost reporting
       In some transactions - for example a currency conversion, or a purchase
       or  sale  of  stock - one commodity is exchanged for another.  In these
       transactions there is a conversion rate, also  called  the  cost  (when
       buying)  or selling price (when selling).  (In hledger docs we just say
       "cost" generically for convenience.)  With the -B/--cost flag,  hledger
       can show amounts "at cost", converted to the cost's commodity.

   Recording costs
       We'll  explore  several ways of recording transactions involving costs.
       These are also summarised at hledger Cookbook > Cost notation.

       Costs can be recorded explicitly in the journal, using the  @  UNITCOST
       or @@ TOTALCOST notation described in Journal > Costs:

       Variant 1

              2022-01-01
                assets:dollars    $-135
                assets:euros       100 @ $1.35   ; $1.35 per euro (unit cost)

       Variant 2

              2022-01-01
                assets:dollars    $-135
                assets:euros       100 @@ $135   ; $135 total cost

       Typically,  writing  the unit cost (variant 1) is preferable; it can be
       more effort, requiring more attention to decimal digits; but it reveals
       the per-unit cost basis, and makes stock sales easier.

       Costs can also be left implicit, and hledger will infer the  cost  that
       is consistent with a balanced transaction:

       Variant 3

              2022-01-01
                assets:dollars    $-135
                assets:euros       100

       Here,  hledger  will  attach a @@ 100 cost to the first amount (you can
       see it with hledger print -x).  This form looks convenient,  but  there
       are downsides:

       o It  sacrifices some error checking.  For example, if you accidentally
         wrote 10 instead of 100, hledger would not be able to detect the mis-
         take.

       o It is sensitive to the order of postings - if they were  reversed,  a
         different entry would be inferred and reports would be different.

       o The per-unit cost basis is not easy to read.

       So  generally this kind of entry is not recommended.  You can make sure
       you have none of these by using -s (strict mode), or by running hledger
       check balanced.

   Reporting at cost
       Now when you add the -B/--cost flag to reports ("B"  is  from  Ledger's
       -B/--basis/--cost  flag),  any  amounts  which have been annotated with
       costs will be converted to their cost's commodity (in the  report  out-
       put).  Ie they will be displayed "at cost" or "at sale price".

       Some things to note:

       o Costs  are  attached to specific posting amounts in specific transac-
         tions, and once recorded they do not  change.   This  contrasts  with
         market prices, which are ambient and fluctuating.

       o Conversion  to  cost  is  performed before conversion to market value
         (described below).

   Equity conversion postings
       There is a problem with the entries above - they are  not  conventional
       Double  Entry  Bookkeeping (DEB) notation, and because of the "magical"
       transformation of one commodity into another, they cause  an  imbalance
       in the Accounting Equation.  This shows up as a non-zero grand total in
       balance reports like hledger bse.

       For  most hledger users, this doesn't matter in practice and can safely
       be ignored !  But if you'd like to learn more, keep reading.

       Conventional DEB uses an extra pair of equity postings to  balance  the
       transaction.  Of course you can do this in hledger as well:

       Variant 4

              2022-01-01
                  assets:dollars      $-135
                  assets:euros         100
                  equity:conversion    $135
                  equity:conversion   -100

       Now  the  transaction  is perfectly balanced according to standard DEB,
       and hledger bse's total will not be disrupted.

       And, hledger can still infer the cost for cost reporting, but it's  not
       done by default - you must add the --infer-costs flag like so:

              $ hledger print --infer-costs
              2022-01-01 one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
                  assets:dollars       $-135 @@ 100
                  assets:euros                  100
                  equity:conversion             $135
                  equity:conversion            -100

              $ hledger bal --infer-costs -B
                             -100  assets:dollars
                              100  assets:euros
              --------------------
                                 0

       Here are some downsides of this kind of entry:

       o The per-unit cost basis is not easy to read.

       o Instead of -B you must remember to type -B --infer-costs.

       o --infer-costs  works  only  where  hledger  can  identify the two eq-
         uity:conversion postings and match them up with  the  two  non-equity
         postings.   So  writing  the journal entry in a particular format be-
         comes more important.  More on this below.

   Inferring equity conversion postings
       Can we go in the other direction ?  Yes, if you have transactions writ-
       ten with the @/@@ cost notation, hledger can infer the  missing  equity
       postings, if you add the --infer-equity flag.  Eg:

              2022-01-01
                assets:dollars  -$135
                assets:euros     100 @ $1.35

              $ hledger print --infer-equity
              2022-01-01
                  assets:dollars                    $-135
                  assets:euros               100 @ $1.35
                  equity:conversion:$-:           -100
                  equity:conversion:$-:$         $135.00

       The  equity  account  names  will be "equity:conversion:A-B:A" and "eq-
       uity:conversion:A-B:B" where A is the  alphabetically  first  commodity
       symbol.  You can customise the "equity:conversion" part by declaring an
       account with the V/Conversion account type.

       Note  you will need to add account declarations for these to your jour-
       nal, if you use check accounts or check --strict.

   Combining costs and equity conversion postings
       Finally, you can use both the @/@@ cost notation and equity postings at
       the same time.  This in theory gives the best of all worlds -  preserv-
       ing  the  accounting  equation,  revealing the per-unit cost basis, and
       providing more flexibility in how you write the entry:

       Variant 5

              2022-01-01 one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
                  assets:dollars      $-135
                  equity:conversion    $135
                  equity:conversion   -100
                  assets:euros         100 @ $1.35

       All the other variants above can (usually) be rewritten to  this  final
       form with:

              $ hledger print -x --infer-costs --infer-equity

       Downsides:

       o The  precise  format of the journal entry becomes more important.  If
         hledger can't detect and match up the cost and  equity  postings,  it
         will give a transaction balancing error.

       o The add command does not yet accept this kind of entry (#2056).

       o This is the most verbose form.

   Requirements for detecting equity conversion postings
       --infer-costs  has  certain  requirements (unlike --infer-equity, which
       always works).  It will infer costs only in transactions with:

       o Two non-equity postings, in different commodities.   Their  order  is
         significant: the cost will be added to the first of them.

       o Two  postings  to  equity  conversion  accounts, next to one another,
         which balance the two non-equity postings.  This balancing is checked
         to the same precision (number of decimal places) used in the  conver-
         sion posting's amount.  Equity conversion accounts are:

         o any accounts declared with account type V/Conversion, or their sub-
           accounts

         o otherwise,  accounts  named equity:conversion, equity:trade, or eq-
           uity:trading, or their subaccounts.

       And multiple such four-posting  groups  can  coexist  within  a  single
       transaction.   When  --infer-costs  fails,  it does not infer a cost in
       that transaction, and does not raise an  error  (ie,  it  infers  costs
       where it can).

       Reading  variant  5 journal entries, combining cost notation and equity
       postings, has all the same requirements.  When reading  such  an  entry
       fails, hledger raises an "unbalanced transaction" error.

   Infer cost and equity by default ?
       Should  --infer-costs  and  --infer-equity be enabled by default ?  Try
       using them always, eg with a shell alias:

              alias h="hledger --infer-equity --infer-costs"

       and let us know what problems you find.

Value reporting
       hledger can also show amounts "at  market  value",  converted  to  some
       other  commodity using the market price or conversion rate on a certain
       date.

       This is controlled by the  --value=TYPE[,COMMODITY]  option.   We  also
       provide  simpler  -V and -X COMMODITY aliases for this, which are often
       sufficient.  The market prices are declared with a special P directive,
       and/or they can be inferred from the costs recorded in transactions, by
       using the --infer-market-prices flag.

   -V: Value
       The -V/--market flag converts amounts to market value in their  default
       valuation commodity, using the market prices in effect on the valuation
       date(s), if any.  More on these in a minute.

   -X: Value in specified commodity
       The -X/--exchange=COMM option is like -V, except you tell it which cur-
       rency  you  want  to  convert to, and it tries to convert everything to
       that.

   Valuation date
       Market prices can change from day to day.  hledger will use the  prices
       on  a particular valuation date (or on more than one date).  By default
       hledger uses "end" dates for valuation.  More specifically:

       o For single period reports (including normal print  and  register  re-
         ports):

         o If an explicit report end date is specified, that is used

         o Otherwise  the  latest transaction date or P directive date is used
           (even if it's in the future)

       o For multiperiod reports, each period is valued on its last day.

       This can be customised with the --value option described  below,  which
       can select either "then", "end", "now", or "custom" dates.  (Note, this
       has a bug in hledger-ui <=1.31: turning on valuation with the V key al-
       ways resets it to "end".)

   Finding market price
       To  convert  a  commodity A to its market value in another commodity B,
       hledger looks for a suitable market price (exchange rate)  as  follows,
       in this order of preference:

       1. A  declared market price or inferred market price: A's latest market
          price in B on or before the valuation date as declared by a P direc-
          tive, or (with the --infer-market-prices flag) inferred from costs.

       2. A reverse market price: the inverse of a declared or inferred market
          price from B to A.

       3. A forward chain of market prices: a synthetic price formed  by  com-
          bining the shortest chain of "forward" (only 1 above) market prices,
          leading from A to B.

       4. Any  chain of market prices: a chain of any market prices, including
          both forward and reverse prices (1 and 2 above), leading from  A  to
          B.

       There  is  a  limit  to  the  length  of these price chains; if hledger
       reaches that length without finding a complete chain or exhausting  all
       possibilities,  it  will  give  up (with a "gave up" message visible in
       --debug=2 output).  That limit is currently 1000.

       Amounts for which no suitable market price can be found, are  not  con-
       verted.

   --infer-market-prices: market prices from transactions
       Normally, market value in hledger is fully controlled by, and requires,
       P directives in your journal.  Since adding and updating those can be a
       chore,  and  since  transactions  usually take place at close to market
       value, why not use the recorded costs as additional market  prices  (as
       Ledger  does)  ?   Adding  the  --infer-market-prices flag to -V, -X or
       --value enables this.

       So for example, hledger bs -V  --infer-market-prices  will  get  market
       prices  both from P directives and from transactions.  If both occur on
       the same day, the P directive takes precedence.

       There is a downside: value reports can sometimes be affected in confus-
       ing/undesired ways by your journal entries.  If this  happens  to  you,
       read  all  of  this  Value  reporting section carefully, and try adding
       --debug or --debug=2 to troubleshoot.

       --infer-market-prices can infer market prices from:

       o multicommodity transactions with explicit prices (@/@@)

       o multicommodity transactions with implicit prices (no @, two  commodi-
         ties,  unbalanced).   (With  these,  the  order  of postings matters.
         hledger print -x can be useful for troubleshooting.)

       o multicommodity transactions with equity postings, if cost is inferred
         with --infer-costs.

       There is a limitation (bug) currently: when a  valuation  commodity  is
       not  specified,  prices inferred with --infer-market-prices do not help
       select a default valuation commodity, as P prices would.  So conversion
       might not happen because no valuation commodity was detected (--debug=2
       will show this).  To be safe, specify the valuation commmodity, eg:

       o -X EUR --infer-market-prices, not -V --infer-market-prices

       o --value=then,EUR --infer-market-prices, not --value=then --infer-mar-
         ket-prices

       Signed costs and market prices can be confusing.  For  reference,  here
       is  the current behaviour, since hledger 1.25.  (If you think it should
       work differently, see #1870.)

   Valuation commodity
       When you specify a valuation commodity (-X COMM or --value TYPE,COMM):
       hledger  will convert all amounts to COMM, wherever it can find a suit-
       able market price (including by reversing or chaining prices).

       When you leave the  valuation  commodity  unspecified  (-V  or  --value
       TYPE):
       For  each  commodity  A, hledger picks a default valuation commodity as
       follows, in this order of preference:

       1. The price commodity from the latest P-declared market price for A on
          or before valuation date.

       2. The price commodity from the latest P-declared market price for A on
          any date.  (Allows conversion to proceed  when  there  are  inferred
          prices before the valuation date.)

       3. If  there are no P directives at all (any commodity or date) and the
          --infer-market-prices flag is used: the  price  commodity  from  the
          latest transaction-inferred price for A on or before valuation date.

       This means:

       o If  you  have  P directives, they determine which commodities -V will
         convert, and to what.

       o If you have no P directives, and use the --infer-market-prices  flag,
         costs determine it.

       Amounts  for  which  no  valuation  commodity can be found are not con-
       verted.

   --value: Flexible valuation
       -V and -X are special cases of the more general --value option:

               --value=TYPE[,COMM]  TYPE is then, end, now or YYYY-MM-DD.
                                    COMM is an optional commodity symbol.
                                    Shows amounts converted to:
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at posting dates
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at period end(s)
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using current market prices
                                    - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at some date

       The TYPE part selects cost or value and valuation date:

       --value=then
              Convert amounts to their value in the default valuation  commod-
              ity, using market prices on each posting's date.

       --value=end
              Convert  amounts to their value in the default valuation commod-
              ity, using market prices on the last day of  the  report  period
              (or  if  unspecified, the journal's end date); or in multiperiod
              reports, market prices on the last day of each subperiod.

       --value=now
              Convert amounts to their value in the default valuation  commod-
              ity  using  current  market  prices (as of when report is gener-
              ated).

       --value=YYYY-MM-DD
              Convert amounts to their value in the default valuation  commod-
              ity using market prices on this date.

       To select a different valuation commodity, add the optional ,COMM part:
       a  comma,  then  the  target  commodity's symbol.  Eg: --value=now,EUR.
       hledger will do its best to convert amounts to this commodity, deducing
       market prices as described above.

   Valuation examples
       Here are some quick examples of -V:

              ; one euro is worth this many dollars from nov 1
              P 2016/11/01  $1.10

              ; purchase some euros on nov 3
              2016/11/3
                  assets:euros        100
                  assets:checking

              ; the euro is worth fewer dollars by dec 21
              P 2016/12/21  $1.03

       How many euros do I have ?

              $ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros
                              100  assets:euros

       What are they worth at end of nov 3 ?

              $ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V -e 2016/11/4
                           $110.00  assets:euros

       What are they worth after 2016/12/21 ?  (no report end date  specified,
       defaults to today)

              $ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V
                           $103.00  assets:euros

   Interaction of valuation and queries
       When  matching  postings based on queries in the presence of valuation,
       the following happens:

       1. The query is separated into two parts:

           1. the currency (cur:) or amount (amt:).

           2. all other parts.

       2. The postings are matched to the currency and amount queries based on
          pre-valued amounts.

       3. Valuation is applied to the postings.

       4. The postings are matched to the other parts of the  query  based  on
          post-valued amounts.

   Effect of valuation on reports
       Here  is  a reference for how valuation is supposed to affect each part
       of hledger's reports.  (It's wide, you may need  to  scroll  sideways.)
       It  may  be  useful when troubleshooting.  If you find problems, please
       report them, ideally  with  a  reproducible  example.   Related:  #329,
       #1083.

       First, a quick glossary:

       cost   calculated using price(s) recorded in the transaction(s).

       value  market  value  using available market price declarations, or the
              unchanged amount if no conversion rate can be found.

       report start
              the first day of the report period specified with -b  or  -p  or
              date:, otherwise today.

       report or journal start
              the  first  day  of the report period specified with -b or -p or
              date:, otherwise the earliest transaction date in  the  journal,
              otherwise today.

       report end
              the  last  day  of  the report period specified with -e or -p or
              date:, otherwise today.

       report or journal end
              the last day of the report period specified with  -e  or  -p  or
              date:,  otherwise  the  latest  transaction date in the journal,
              otherwise today.

       report interval
              a flag (-D/-W/-M/-Q/-Y) or period expression that activates  the
              report's multi-period mode (whether showing one or many subperi-
              ods).

Help commands
   commands
       Show the hledger commands list.

              Flags:
                   --builtin             show only builtin commands, not addons

   demo
       Play demos of hledger usage in the terminal, if asciinema is installed.

              Flags:
                -s --speed=SPEED         playback speed (1 is original speed, .5 is half, 2
                                         is double, etc (default: 2))

       Run  this  command with no argument to list the demos.  To play a demo,
       write its number or a prefix or substring of its title.  Tips:

       Make your terminal window large enough to see the demo clearly.

       Use the -s/--speed SPEED option to set your preferred  playback  speed,
       eg -s4 to play at 4x original speed or -s.5 to play at half speed.  The
       default speed is 2x.

       Other  asciinema  options  can  be added following a double dash, eg --
       -i.1 to limit pauses or -- -h to list asciinema's other options.

       During playback, several keys are available: SPACE to pause/unpause,  .
       to step forward (while paused), CTRL-c quit.

       Examples:

              $ hledger demo               # list available demos
              $ hledger demo 1             # play the first demo at default speed (2x)
              $ hledger demo install -s4   # play the "install" demo at 4x speed

       This command is experimental: there aren't many useful demos yet.

   help
       Show  the hledger user manual with info, man, or a pager.  With a (case
       insensitive) TOPIC argument, try to open it at that section heading.

              Flags:
                -i                       show the manual with info
                -m                       show the manual with man
                -p                       show the manual with $PAGER or less
                                         (less is always used if TOPIC is specified)

       This command shows the hledger manual built in  to  your  hledger  exe-
       cutable.   It can be useful when offline, or when you prefer the termi-
       nal to a web browser, or when the appropriate hledger manual or viewers
       are not installed properly on your system.

       By default it chooses the best viewer found in $PATH,  trying  in  this
       order:  info,  man,  $PAGER, less, more, stdout.  (If a TOPIC is speci-
       fied, $PAGER and more are not tried.)  You can force the use  of  info,
       man,  or  a  pager  with  the -i, -m, or -p flags.  If no viewer can be
       found, or if running non-interactively, it just prints  the  manual  to
       stdout.

       When  using  info, TOPIC can match either the full heading or a prefix.
       If your info --version is < 6, you'll need to upgrade it, eg with 'brew
       install texinfo' on mac.

       When using man or less, TOPIC must match the full heading.  For a  pre-
       fix match, you can write 'TOPIC.*'.

       Examples

              $ hledger help -h                 # show the help command's usage
              $ hledger help                    # show the manual with info, man or $PAGER
              $ hledger help 'time periods'     # show the manual's "Time periods" topic
              $ hledger help 'time periods' -m  # use man, even if info is installed

User interface commands
   repl
       Start  an  interactive  prompt, where you can run any of hledger's com-
       mands.  Data files are parsed just once, so the commands run faster.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       This command is experimental and could change in the future.

       hledger repl starts a read-eval-print loop (REPL) where you  can  enter
       commands  interactively.   As with the run command, each input file (or
       each input file/input options combination) is parsed just once, so com-
       mands will run more quickly than if you ran them  individually  at  the
       command line.

       Also like run, the input file(s) specified for the repl command will be
       the  default input for all interactive commands.  You can override this
       temporarily by specifying an -f option  in  particular  commands.   But
       note  that commands will not see any changes made to input files (eg by
       add) until you exit and restart the REPL.

       The command syntax is the same as with run:

       o enter one hledger command at a time, without the usual hledger  first
         word

       o empty lines and comment text from # to end of line are ignored

       o use single or double quotes to quote arguments when needed

       o type exit or quit or control-D to exit the REPL.

       While  it  is running, the REPL remembers your command history, and you
       can navigate in the usual ways:

       o Keypad or Emacs navigation keys to edit the current command line

       o UP/DOWN or control-P/control-N to step back/forward through history

       o control-R to search for a past command

       o TAB to complete file paths.

       Generally repl command lines should feel much like the  normal  hledger
       CLI,  but  you  may find differences.  repl is a little stricter; eg it
       requires full command names or official abbreviations (as seen  in  the
       commands list).

       The commands and help commands, and the command help flags (CMD --tldr,
       CMD -h/--help, CMD --info, CMD --man), can be useful.

       You can type control-C to cancel a long-running command (but only once;
       typing it a second time will exit the REPL).

       And  in  most  shells you can type control-Z to temporarily exit to the
       shell (and then fg to return to the REPL).

   Examples
       Start the REPL and enter some commands:

              $ hledger repl
              Enter hledger commands. To exit, enter 'quit' or 'exit', or send EOF.
              % stats
              Main file           : .../2025.journal
              ...
              % stats -f 2024/2024.journal
              Main file           : .../2024.journal
              ...
              % stats
              Main file           : .../2025.journal
              ...

       or:

              $ hledger repl -f some.journal
              Enter hledger commands. To exit, enter 'quit' or 'exit', or send EOF.
              % bs
              ...
              % print -b 'last week'
              ...
              % bs -f other.journal
              ...

   run
       Run a sequence of hledger commands, provided as files or  command  line
       arguments.   Data  files  are  parsed  just  once,  so the commands run
       faster.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       This command is experimental and could change in the future.

       You can use run in three ways:

       o hledger run -- CMD1 -- CMD2 -- CMD3 - read commands from the  command
         line, separated by --

       o hledger  run SCRIPTFILE1 SCRIPTFILE2 - read commands from one or more
         files

       o cat SCRIPTFILE1 | hledger run - read commands from standard input.

       run first loads the input file(s) specified by LEDGER_FILE or by -f op-
       tions, in the usual way.  Then it runs each command in turn, each using
       the same input data.  But if you want a particular command to use  dif-
       ferent  input,  you can specify an -f option within that command.  This
       will override (not add to) the default input, just for that command.

       Each input file (more precisely, each combination of input file and in-
       put options) is parsed only once.  This means that  commands  will  not
       see  any changes made to these files, until the next run.  But the com-
       mands will run more quickly than if run individually  (typically  about
       twice as fast).

       Command scripts, whether in a file or written on the command line, have
       a simple syntax:

       o each  line  may  contain  a single hledger command and its arguments,
         without the usual hledger first word

       o empty lines are ignored

       o text from # to end of line is a comment, and ignored

       o you can use single or double quotes to quote arguments  when  needed,
         as on the command line

       o these  extra  commands are available: echo TEXT prints some text, and
         exit or quit ends the run.

       On unix systems you can use #!/usr/bin/env hledger  run  in  the  first
       line  of a command file to make it a runnable script.  If that gives an
       error, use #!/usr/bin/env -S hledger run.

       It's ok to use the run command recursively within a command script.

       You may find some differences in behaviour between  run  command  lines
       and  normal hledger command lines.  run is a little stricter; eg it re-
       quires full command names or official abbreviations  (as  seen  in  the
       commands  list),  and command options must be written after the command
       name.

   Examples
       Run commands from the command line:

              hledger -f some.journal run -- balance assets --depth 2 -- balance liabilities -f /some/other.journal --depth 3 --transpose -- stats

       This would load some.journal, run balance assets --depth 2 on it,  then
       run  balance  liabilities --depth 3 --transpose on /some/other.journal,
       and finally run stats on some.journal

       Run commands from standard input:

              (echo "files"; echo "stats") | hledger -f some.journal run

       Run commands as a script:

              $ cat report
              #!/usr/bin/env -S hledger run -f some.journal

              echo "List of accounts in some.journal"
              accounts

              echo "Assets of some.journal"
              balance assets --depth 2

              echo "Liabilities from /some/other.journal"
              balance liabilities -f /some/other.journal --depth 3 --transpose

              echo "Commands from another.script, applied to another.journal"
              run -f another.journal another.script

              $ chmod +x report
              $ ./report
              List of accounts in some.journal
              ...

   ui
       Runs hledger-ui (if installed).

   web
       Runs hledger-web (if installed).

Data entry commands
   add
       Record new transactions with interactive prompting in the console.

              Flags:
                   --no-new-accounts      don't allow creating new accounts

       Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor,  or
       generate  them from CSV.  For more interactive data entry, there is the
       add command, which prompts interactively on the console for new  trans-
       actions,  and appends them to the main journal file (which should be in
       journal format).  Existing transactions are not changed.  This  is  one
       of  the  few hledger commands that writes to the journal file (see also
       import).

       To use it, just run hledger add and follow the prompts.  You can add as
       many transactions as you like; when you are finished, enter . or  press
       control-d or control-c to exit.

       Features:

       o add  tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar (by de-
         scription) recent transaction (filtered by the query, if  any)  as  a
         template.

       o You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.

       o Readline-style edit keys can be used during data entry.

       o The  tab  key  will  auto-complete whenever possible - accounts, pay-
         ees/descriptions, dates (yesterday, today, tomorrow).  If  the  input
         area is empty, it will insert the default value.

       o A parenthesised transaction code may be entered following a date.

       o Comments and tags may be entered following a description or amount.

       o If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to go one step backward.

       o Input  prompts  are displayed in a different colour when the terminal
         supports it.

       Notes:

       o If you enter a number with no commodity symbol, and you have declared
         a default commodity with a D directive, you might expect add  to  add
         this  symbol for you.  It does not do this; we assume that if you are
         using a D directive you prefer not to see the  commodity  symbol  re-
         peated on amounts in the journal.

       Examples:

       o Record new transactions, saving to the default journal file:

         hledger add

       o Add transactions to 2024.journal, but also load 2023.journal for com-
         pletions:

         hledger add --file 2024.journal --file 2023.journal

       o Provide answers for the first four prompts:

         hledger add today 'best buy' expenses:supplies '$20'

       There is a detailed tutorial at https://hledger.org/add.html.

   import
       Import  new  transactions from one or more data files to the main jour-
       nal.

              Flags:
                   --catchup              just mark all transactions as already imported
                   --dry-run              just show the transactions to be imported

       This command detects new transactions in one or more data files  speci-
       fied as arguments, and appends them to the main journal.

       You  can  import  from  any  input  file  format  hledger supports, but
       CSV/SSV/TSV files, downloaded from financial institutions, are the most
       common import source.

       The import destination is the default journal file, or  another  speci-
       fied  in the usual way with $LEDGER_FILE or -f/--file.  It should be in
       journal format.

       Examples:

              $ hledger import bank1-checking.csv bank1-savings.csv

              $ hledger import *.csv

   Import preview
       It's useful to preview the import by running first with  --dry-run,  to
       sanity check the range of dates being imported, and to check the effect
       of your conversion rules if converting from CSV.  Eg:

              $ hledger import bank.csv --dry-run

       The dry run output is valid journal format, so hledger can re-parse it.
       If  the output is large, you could show just the uncategorised transac-
       tions like so:

              $ hledger import --dry-run bank.csv | hledger -f- -I print unknown

       You could also run this repeatedly to see the effect of edits  to  your
       conversion rules:

              $ watchexec -- 'hledger import --dry-run bank.csv | hledger -f- -I print unknown'

       Once  the conversion and dates look good enough to import to your jour-
       nal, perhaps with some manual fixups to follow, you would do the actual
       import:

              $ hledger import bank.csv

   Overlap detection
       Reading CSV files is built in to hledger, and not specific  to  import;
       so   you   could  also  import  by  doing  hledger  -f  bank.csv  print
       >>$LEDGER_FILE.

       But import is easier and provides some advantages.   The  main  one  is
       that  it avoids re-importing transactions it has seen on previous runs.
       This means you don't have to worry about overlapping data in successive
       downloads of your bank CSV; just download and import as  often  as  you
       like, and only the new transactions will be imported each time.

       We  don't  call this "deduplication", as it's generally not possible to
       reliably detect duplicates in bank CSV.  Instead, import remembers  the
       latest  date processed previously in each CSV file (saving it in a hid-
       den file), and skips any records prior to that date.  This  works  well
       for most real-world CSV, where:

       1. the data file name is stable (does not change) across imports

       2. the item dates are stable across imports

       3. the order of same-date items is stable across imports

       4. the newest items have the newest dates

       (Occasional  violations  of  2-4 are often harmless; you can reduce the
       chance of disruption by downloading and importing more often.)

       Overlap detection is automatic, and shouldn't  require  much  attention
       from  you,  except perhaps at first import (see below).  But here's how
       it works:

       o For each FILE being imported from:

         1. hledger reads a file named .latest.FILE file in  the  same  direc-
            tory,  if  any.   This file contains the latest record date previ-
            ously imported from  FILE,  in  YYYY-MM-DD  format.   If  multiple
            records  with  that  date were imported, the date is repeated on N
            lines.

         2. hledger reads records from FILE.  If a latest date  was  found  in
            step  1,  any records before that date, and the first N records on
            that date, are skipped.

       o After a successful import from all FILEs, without error  and  without
         --dry-run, hledger updates each FILE's .latest.FILE for next time.

       If this goes wrong, it's relatively easy to repair:

       o You'll   notice  it  before  import  when  you  preview  with  import
         --dry-run.

       o Or after import when you try to reconcile your hledger  account  bal-
         ances with your bank.

       o hledger  print -f FILE.csv will show all recently downloaded transac-
         tions.  Compare these with your journal.  Copy/paste if needed.

       o Update your conversion rules and print again, if needed.

       o You can manually update or remove the .latest  file,  or  use  import
         --catchup FILE.

       o Download  and  import more often, eg twice a week, at least while you
         are learning.  It's easier to review and troubleshoot when there  are
         fewer transactions.

   First import
       The  first  time  you import from a file, when no corresponding .latest
       file has been created yet, all of the records will be imported.

       But perhaps you have been entering the data manually, so you know  that
       all of these transactions are already recorded in the journal.  In this
       case  you  can  run  hledger import --catchup once.  This will create a
       .latest file containing the latest CSV record date,  so  that  none  of
       those records will be re-imported.

       Or,  if  you  know that some but not all of the transactions are in the
       journal, you can create the .latest file yourself.  Eg, let's  say  you
       previously  recorded foobank transactions up to 2024-10-31 in the jour-
       nal.  Then in the directory where you'll  be  saving  foobank.csv,  you
       would create a .latest.foobank.csv file containing

              2024-10-31

       Or  if  you had three foobank transactions recorded with that date, you
       would repeat the date that many times:

              2024-10-31
              2024-10-31
              2024-10-31

       Then hledger import foobank.csv [--dry-run] will import only the  newer
       records.

   Importing balance assignments
       Journal  entries added by import will have all posting amounts made ex-
       plicit (like print -x).

       This means that any balance assignments in the imported  entries  would
       need  to  be evaluated.  But this generally isn't possible, as the main
       file's account balances are not visible during import.  So try to avoid
       generating balance assignments with your CSV rules, or importing from a
       journal that contains balance assignments.   (Balance  assignments  are
       best avoided anyway.)

       But  if  you must use them, eg because your CSV includes only balances:
       you can import with print,  which  leaves  implicit  amounts  implicit.
       (print can also do overlap detection like import, with the --new flag):

              $ hledger print --new -f bank.csv >> $LEDGER_FILE

       (If  you  think  import  should preserve implicit balances, please test
       that and send a pull request.)

   Import and commodity styles
       Amounts in entries added by import will be formatted according  to  the
       journal's  canonical  commodity styles, as declared by commodity direc-
       tives or inferred from the journal's amounts.

       Related: CSV > Amount decimal places.

   Import special cases
       If you have a download whose file name varies, you could rename it to a
       fixed name after each download.  Or you could use  a  CSV  source  rule
       with  a  suitable glob pattern, and import from the .rules file instead
       of the data file.

       Here's a situation where you would need to run import  with  care:  say
       you  download bank.csv, but forget to import it or delete it.  And next
       month you download it again.  This time your web browser may save it as
       bank (2).csv.  So now each of these may have data not included  in  the
       other.  And a source rule with a glob pattern would match only the most
       recent  file.  So in this case you should import from each one in turn,
       in the correct order, taking care to use the same filename each time:

              $ hledger import bank.csv
              $ mv 'bank (2).csv' bank.csv
              $ hledger import bank.csv

       Here are two kinds of "deduplication" which import does not handle (and
       generally should not, since these can happen legitimately in  financial
       data):

       o Two  or more of the new CSV records are identical, and generate iden-
         tical new journal entries.

       o A new CSV record generates a journal entry identical  to  one(s)  al-
         ready in the journal.

Basic report commands
   accounts
       List account names.

              Flags:
                -u --used                 show only accounts used by transactions
                -d --declared             show only accounts declared by account directive
                   --unused               show only accounts declared but not used
                   --undeclared           show only accounts used but not declared
                   --types                also show account types when known
                   --positions            also show where accounts were declared
                   --directives           show as account directives, for use in journals
                   --find                 find the first account matched by the first
                                          argument (a case-insensitive infix regexp or
                                          account name)
                -l --flat                 list/tree mode: show accounts as a flat list
                                          (default)
                -t --tree                 list/tree mode: show accounts as a tree
                   --drop=N               flat mode: omit N leading account name parts

       This  command  lists  account names.  By default it shows all known ac-
       counts, either used in transactions or  declared  with  account  direc-
       tives.

       With query arguments, only matched account names and account names ref-
       erenced by matched postings are shown.

       Or  it  can  show  just the used accounts (--used/-u), the declared ac-
       counts (--declared/-d), the accounts declared but not used  (--unused),
       the accounts used but not declared (--undeclared), or the first account
       matched by an account name pattern, if any (--find).

       It  shows  a flat list by default.  With --tree, it uses indentation to
       show the account hierarchy.  In flat mode you can add --drop N to  omit
       the   first   few  account  name  components.   Account  names  can  be
       depth-clipped with depth:N or --depth N or -N.

       With --types, it also shows each account's type, if it's  known.   (See
       Declaring accounts > Account types.)

       With  --positions,  it  also shows the file and line number of each ac-
       count's declaration, if any, and the account's overall declaration  or-
       der; these may be useful when troubleshooting account display order.

       With  --directives,  it adds the account keyword, showing valid account
       directives which can be pasted into a journal file.  This is useful to-
       gether with --undeclared when updating  your  account  declarations  to
       satisfy hledger check accounts.

       The  --find  flag  can be used to look up a single account name, in the
       same way that the aregister command does.  It returns the  alphanumeri-
       cally-first  matched  account  name,  or if none can be found, it fails
       with a non-zero exit code.

       Examples:

              $ hledger accounts
              assets:bank:checking
              assets:bank:saving
              assets:cash
              expenses:food
              expenses:supplies
              income:gifts
              income:salary
              liabilities:debts

              $ hledger accounts --undeclared --directives >> $LEDGER_FILE
              $ hledger check accounts

   codes
       List the codes seen in transactions, in the order parsed.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       This command prints the value of each transaction's code field, in  the
       order  transactions  were  parsed.  The transaction code is an optional
       value written in parentheses between the date  and  description,  often
       used to store a cheque number, order number or similar.

       Transactions aren't required to have a code, and missing or empty codes
       will  not  be shown by default.  With the -E/--empty flag, they will be
       printed as blank lines.

       You can add a query to select a subset of transactions.

       Examples:

              2022/1/1 (123) Supermarket
               Food       $5.00
               Checking

              2022/1/2 (124) Post Office
               Postage    $8.32
               Checking

              2022/1/3 Supermarket
               Food      $11.23
               Checking

              2022/1/4 (126) Post Office
               Postage    $3.21
               Checking

              $ hledger codes
              123
              124
              126

              $ hledger codes -E
              123
              124

              126

   commodities
       List all commodity/currency symbols used or declared in the journal.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

   descriptions
       List the unique descriptions that appear in transactions.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       This command lists the unique descriptions that appear in transactions,
       in alphabetic order.  You can add a query to select a subset of  trans-
       actions.

       Example:

              $ hledger descriptions
              Store Name
              Gas Station | Petrol
              Person A

   files
       List  all  files  included in the journal.  With a REGEX argument, only
       file names matching the regular expression (case sensitive) are shown.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

   notes
       List the unique notes that appear in transactions.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       This command lists the unique notes that appear in transactions, in al-
       phabetic order.  You can add a query to select  a  subset  of  transac-
       tions.   The  note is the part of the transaction description after a |
       character (or if there is no |, the whole description).

       Example:

              $ hledger notes
              Petrol
              Snacks

   payees
       List the unique payee/payer names that appear in transactions.

              Flags:
                   --declared             show payees declared with payee directives
                   --used                 show payees referenced by transactions

       This command lists unique payee/payer names which  have  been  declared
       with  payee  directives  (--declared), used in transaction descriptions
       (--used), or both (the default).

       The payee/payer is the part of the transaction description before  a  |
       character (or if there is no |, the whole description).

       You  can  add query arguments to select a subset of transactions.  This
       implies --used.

       Example:

              $ hledger payees
              Store Name
              Gas Station
              Person A

   prices
       Print the market prices declared with P directives.  With  --infer-mar-
       ket-prices,  also show any additional prices inferred from costs.  With
       --show-reverse, also show additional prices inferred by reversing known
       prices.

              Flags:
                   --show-reverse         also show the prices inferred by reversing known
                                          prices

       Price amounts are always displayed with their  full  precision,  except
       for reverse prices which are limited to 8 decimal digits.

       Prices can be filtered by a date:, cur: or amt: query.

       Generally if you run this command with --infer-market-prices --show-re-
       verse,  it will show the same prices used internally to calculate value
       reports.  But if in doubt, you can inspect those  directly  by  running
       the value report with --debug=2.

   stats
       Show journal and performance statistics.

              Flags:
                -v --verbose              show more detailed output
                -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE.

       The stats command shows summary information for the whole journal, or a
       matched  part  of it.  With a reporting interval, it shows a report for
       each report period.

       The default output is fairly impersonal, though  it  reveals  the  main
       file name.  With -v/--verbose, more details are shown, like file paths,
       included files, and commodity names.

       It also shows some run time statistics:

       o elapsed time

       o throughput: the number of transactions processed per second

       o live: the peak memory in use by the program to do its work

       o alloc:  the  peak memory allocation from the OS as seen by GHC.  Mea-
         suring this externally, eg with GNU time, is more  accurate;  usually
         that will be a larger number; sometimes (with swapping?)  smaller.

       The stats command's run time is similar to that of a balance report.

       Example:

              $ hledger stats -f examples/1ktxns-1kaccts.journal
              Main file           : .../1ktxns-1kaccts.journal
              Included files      : 0
              Txns span           : 2000-01-01 to 2002-09-27 (1000 days)
              Last txn            : 2002-09-26 (7827 days ago)
              Txns                : 1000 (1.0 per day)
              Txns last 30 days   : 0 (0.0 per day)
              Txns last 7 days    : 0 (0.0 per day)
              Payees/descriptions : 1000
              Accounts            : 1000 (depth 10)
              Commodities         : 26
              Market prices       : 1000
              Runtime stats       : 0.12 s elapsed, 8266 txns/s, 4 MB live, 16 MB alloc

       This  command  supports  the -o/--output-file option (but not -O/--out-
       put-format).

   tags
       List the tags used in the journal, or their values.

              Flags:
                   --values               list tag values instead of tag names
                   --parsed               show tags/values in the order they were parsed,
                                          including duplicates

       This command lists the tag names used in the journal, whether on trans-
       actions, postings, or account declarations.

       With a TAGREGEX argument, only tag names matching this regular  expres-
       sion (case insensitive, infix matched) are shown.

       With  QUERY  arguments,  only  transactions  and accounts matching this
       query are considered.  If the query involves transaction fields (date:,
       desc:, amt:, ...), the search is restricted to the matched transactions
       and their accounts.

       With the --values flag, the tags' unique non-empty  values  are  listed
       instead.  With -E/--empty, blank/empty values are also shown.

       With  --parsed, tags or values are shown in the order they were parsed,
       with duplicates included.  (Except, tags from account declarations  are
       always shown first.)

       Tip:  remember, accounts also acquire tags from their parents, postings
       also acquire tags from their account and transaction, transactions also
       acquire tags from their postings.

Standard report commands
   print
       Show full journal entries, representing transactions.

              Flags:
                -x --explicit             show all amounts explicitly
                   --show-costs           show transaction prices even with conversion
                                          postings
                   --round=TYPE           how much rounding or padding should be done when
                                          displaying amounts ?
                                          none - show original decimal digits,
                                                 as in journal (default)
                                          soft - just add or remove decimal zeros
                                                 to match precision
                                          hard - round posting amounts to precision
                                                 (can unbalance transactions)
                                          all  - also round cost amounts to precision
                                                 (can unbalance transactions)
                   --invert               display all amounts with reversed sign
                   --new                  show only newer-dated transactions added in each
                                          file since last run
                -m --match=DESC           fuzzy search for one recent transaction with
                                          description closest to DESC
                   --base-url=URLPREFIX   in html output, generate links to hledger-web,
                                          with this prefix. (Usually the base url shown by
                                          hledger-web; can also be relative.)
                   --location             add file/line number tags to print output
                -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                                          txt, beancount, csv, tsv, html, fods, json, sql.
                -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                                          one of the above formats selects that format.

       The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from the
       journal file, sorted by date (or with --date2, by secondary date).

       Directives and inter-transaction comments  are  not  shown,  currently.
       This means the print command is somewhat lossy, and if you are using it
       to  reformat/regenerate  your journal you should take care to also copy
       over the directives and inter-transaction comments.

       Eg:

              $ hledger print -f examples/sample.journal date:200806
              2008/06/01 gift
                  assets:bank:checking            $1
                  income:gifts                   $-1

              2008/06/02 save
                  assets:bank:saving              $1
                  assets:bank:checking           $-1

   print explicitness
       Normally, whether posting amounts are  implicit  or  explicit  is  pre-
       served.  For example, when an amount is omitted in the journal, it will
       not  appear  in the output.  Similarly, if a conversion cost is implied
       but not written, it will not appear in the output.

       You can use the -x/--explicit flag to force  explicit  display  of  all
       amounts  and costs.  This can be useful for troubleshooting or for mak-
       ing your journal more readable and robust against  data  entry  errors.
       -x is also implied by using any of -B,-V,-X,--value.

       The  -x/--explicit  flag will cause any postings with a multi-commodity
       amount (which can arise when a multi-commodity transaction has  an  im-
       plicit  amount)  to  be  split into multiple single-commodity postings,
       keeping the output parseable.

   print amount style
       Amounts are  shown  right-aligned  within  each  transaction  (but  not
       aligned  across  all  transactions; you can do that with ledger-mode in
       Emacs).

       Amounts will be (mostly) normalised to their commodity  display  style:
       their  symbol  placement,  decimal  mark, and digit group marks will be
       made consistent.  By default, decimal digits  are  shown  as  they  are
       written in the journal.

       With  the  --round  (Added in 1.32) option, print will try increasingly
       hard to display decimal  digits  according  to  the  commodity  display
       styles:

       o --round=none show amounts with original precisions (default)

       o --round=soft add/remove decimal zeros in amounts (except costs)

       o --round=hard  round  amounts (except costs), possibly hiding signifi-
         cant digits

       o --round=all round all amounts and costs

       soft is good for non-lossy cleanup,  formatting  amounts  more  consis-
       tently where it's safe to do so.

       hard  and  all  can  cause print to show invalid unbalanced journal en-
       tries; they may be useful eg for stronger cleanup, with  manual  fixups
       when needed.

   print parseability
       print's  output is usually a valid hledger journal, and you can process
       it again with a second hledger command.  This can be useful for certain
       kinds of search (though the same can be  achieved  with  expr:  queries
       now):

              # Show running total of food expenses paid from cash.
              # -f- reads from stdin. -I/--ignore-assertions is sometimes needed.
              $ hledger print assets:cash | hledger -f- -I reg expenses:food

       There are some situations where print's output can become unparseable:

       o Value  reporting affects posting amounts but not balance assertion or
         balance assignment amounts, potentially causing those to fail.

       o Auto postings can generate postings with too many missing amounts.

       o Account aliases can generate bad account names.

   print, other features
       With -B/--cost, amounts with costs are shown converted to cost.

       With --invert, posting amounts are shown with their sign  flipped.   It
       could  be  useful  if  you have accidentally recorded some transactions
       with the wrong signs.

       With --new, print shows only transactions it has not seen on a previous
       run.  This uses the same deduplication system as  the  import  command.
       (See import's docs for details.)

       With -m DESC/--match=DESC, print shows one recent transaction whose de-
       scription  is  most  similar to DESC.  DESC should contain at least two
       characters.  If there is no similar-enough match, no  transaction  will
       be shown and the program exit code will be non-zero.

       With  --location,  print  adds the source file and line number to every
       transaction, as a tag.

   print output format
       This command also supports the output destination and output format op-
       tions The output formats supported are txt, beancount (Added in  1.32),
       csv, tsv (Added in 1.32), json and sql.

       The  beancount  format tries to produce Beancount-compatible output, as
       follows:

       o Transaction and  postings  with  unmarked  status  are  converted  to
         cleared (*) status.

       o Transactions'   payee   and   note  are  backslash-escaped  and  dou-
         ble-quote-escaped and wrapped in double quotes.

       o Transaction tags are copied to Beancount #tag format.

       o Commodity symbols are converted to upper case, and a small number  of
         currency  symbols  like $ are converted to the corresponding currency
         names.

       o Account name parts are capitalised and unsupported characters are re-
         placed with -.  If an account name part does not begin with a letter,
         or if the first part is not Assets, Liabilities, Equity,  Income,  or
         Expenses, an error is raised.  (Use --alias options to bring your ac-
         counts into compliance.)

       o An open directive is generated for each account used, on the earliest
         transaction date.

       Some limitations:

       o Balance assertions are removed.

       o Balance assignments become missing amounts.

       o Virtual and balanced virtual postings become regular postings.

       o Directives are not converted.

       Here's an example of print's CSV output:

              $ hledger print -Ocsv
              "txnidx","date","date2","status","code","description","comment","account","amount","commodity","credit","debit","posting-status","posting-comment"
              "1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
              "1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","income:salary","-1","$","1","","",""
              "2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
              "2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","income:gifts","-1","$","1","","",""
              "3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:saving","1","$","","1","",""
              "3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""
              "4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:food","1","$","","1","",""
              "4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:supplies","1","$","","1","",""
              "4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","assets:cash","-2","$","2","","",""
              "5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","liabilities:debts","1","$","","1","",""
              "5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""

       o There  is  one  CSV record per posting, with the parent transaction's
         fields repeated.

       o The "txnidx" (transaction index) field shows which postings belong to
         the same transaction.  (This number might change if transactions  are
         reordered  within  the file, files are parsed/included in a different
         order, etc.)

       o The amount is separated into "commodity" (the  symbol)  and  "amount"
         (numeric quantity) fields.

       o The numeric amount is repeated in either the "credit" or "debit" col-
         umn,  for convenience.  (Those names are not accurate in the account-
         ing sense; it just puts negative amounts under  credit  and  zero  or
         greater amounts under debit.)

   aregister
       (areg)

       Show  the  transactions  and running balances in one account, with each
       transaction on one line.

              Flags:
                   --txn-dates            filter strictly by transaction date, not posting
                                          date. Warning: this can show a wrong running
                                          balance.
                   --no-elide             don't show only 2 commodities per amount
                   --cumulative           accumulation mode: show running total from report
                                          start date
                -H --historical           accumulation mode: show historical running
                                          total/balance (includes postings before report
                                          start date) (default)
                   --invert               display all amounts with reversed sign
                   --heading=YN           show heading row above table: yes (default) or no
                -w --width=N              set output width (default: terminal width). -wN,M
                                          sets description width as well.
                   --align-all            guarantee alignment across all lines (slower)
                -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                                          txt, html, csv, tsv, json.
                -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                                          one of the above formats selects that format.

       aregister shows the overall transactions affecting a particular account
       (and any subaccounts).  Each report line represents one transaction  in
       this  account.   Transactions before the report start date are included
       in the running balance (--historical mode is  the  default).   You  can
       suppress this behaviour using the --cumulative option.

       This  is  a more "real world", bank-like view than the register command
       (which shows individual postings, possibly from multiple accounts,  not
       necessarily in historical mode).  As a quick rule of thumb: - use areg-
       ister for reviewing and reconciling real-world asset/liability accounts
       - use register for reviewing detailed revenues/expenses.

       aregister  requires  one  argument:  the account to report on.  You can
       write either the full account name, or a case-insensitive  regular  ex-
       pression which will select the alphabetically first matched account.

       When there are multiple matches, the alphabetically-first choice can be
       surprising;  eg if you have assets:per:checking 1 and assets:biz:check-
       ing 2 accounts, hledger areg checking would select  assets:biz:checking
       2.   It's  just a convenience to save typing, so if in doubt, write the
       full account name, or a distinctive substring that matches uniquely.

       Transactions involving subaccounts of this account will also be  shown.
       aregister  ignores depth limits, so its final total will always match a
       balance report with similar arguments.

       Any additional arguments form a query which will  filter  the  transac-
       tions shown.  Note some queries will disturb the running balance, caus-
       ing it to be different from the account's real-world running balance.

       An  example: this shows the transactions and historical running balance
       during july, in the first account whose name contains "checking":

              $ hledger areg checking date:jul

       Each aregister line item shows:

       o the transaction's date (or the relevant posting's date if  different,
         see below)

       o the  names  of  all the other account(s) involved in this transaction
         (probably abbreviated)

       o the total change to this account's balance from this transaction

       o the account's historical running balance after this transaction.

       Transactions making a net change of zero are not shown by default;  add
       the -E/--empty flag to show them.

       For  performance  reasons,  column widths are chosen based on the first
       1000 lines; this means unusually wide values in later lines  can  cause
       visual  discontinuities  as column widths are adjusted.  If you want to
       ensure perfect alignment, at the cost of more time and memory, use  the
       --align-all flag.

       By  default,  aregister  shows a heading above the data.  However, when
       reporting in a language different from English, it is  easier  to  omit
       this  heading  and  prepend  your  own  one.  For this purpose, use the
       --heading=no option.

       This command also supports the output destination and output format op-
       tions.  The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv (Added in 1.32),
       html, fods (Added in 1.41) and json.

   aregister and posting dates
       aregister always shows one line (and date and amount) per  transaction.
       But  sometimes  transactions have postings with different dates.  Also,
       not all of a transaction's postings may be within  the  report  period.
       To resolve this, aregister shows the earliest of the transaction's date
       and posting dates that is in-period, and the sum of the in-period post-
       ings.   In  other words it will show a combined line item with just the
       earliest date, and the running balance  will  (temporarily,  until  the
       transaction's last posting) be inaccurate.  Use register -H if you need
       to see the individual postings.

       There is also a --txn-dates flag, which filters strictly by transaction
       date, ignoring posting dates.  This too can cause an inaccurate running
       balance.

   register
       (reg)

       Show postings and their running total.

              Flags:
                   --cumulative           accumulation mode: show running total from report
                                          start date (default)
                -H --historical           accumulation mode: show historical running
                                          total/balance (includes postings before report
                                          start date)
                -A --average              show running average of posting amounts instead
                                          of total (implies --empty)
                -m --match=DESC           fuzzy search for one recent posting with
                                          description closest to DESC
                -r --related              show postings' siblings instead
                   --invert               display all amounts with reversed sign
                   --sort=FIELDS          sort by: date, desc, account, amount, absamount,
                                          or a comma-separated combination of these. For a
                                          descending sort, prefix with -. (Default: date)
                -w --width=N              set output width (default: terminal width). -wN,M
                                          sets description width as well.
                   --align-all            guarantee alignment across all lines (slower)
                   --base-url=URLPREFIX   in html output, generate links to hledger-web,
                                          with this prefix. (Usually the base url shown by
                                          hledger-web; can also be relative.)
                -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                                          txt, csv, tsv, html, fods, json.
                -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                                          one of the above formats selects that format.

       The register command displays matched postings, across all accounts, in
       date  order,  with  their  running total or running historical balance.
       (See also the aregister command, which shows matched transactions in  a
       specific account.)

       register normally shows line per posting, but note that multi-commodity
       amounts will occupy multiple lines (one line per commodity).

       It  is  typically  used with a query selecting a particular account, to
       see that account's activity:

              $ hledger register checking
              2008/01/01 income               assets:bank:checking            $1           $1
              2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
              2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
              2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0

       With --date2, it shows and sorts by secondary date instead.

       For performance reasons, column widths are chosen based  on  the  first
       1000  lines;  this means unusually wide values in later lines can cause
       visual discontinuities as column widths are adjusted.  If you  want  to
       ensure  perfect alignment, at the cost of more time and memory, use the
       --align-all flag.

       The --historical/-H flag adds the balance from  any  undisplayed  prior
       postings  to  the  running  total.  This is useful when you want to see
       only recent activity, with a historically accurate running balance:

              $ hledger register checking -b 2008/6 --historical
              2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
              2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
              2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0

       The --depth option limits the amount of sub-account detail displayed.

       The --average/-A flag shows the running average posting amount  instead
       of the running total (so, the final number displayed is the average for
       the  whole  report period).  This flag implies --empty (see below).  It
       is affected by --historical.  It works best when showing just  one  ac-
       count and one commodity.

       The  --related/-r  flag shows the other postings in the transactions of
       the postings which would normally be shown.

       The --invert flag negates all amounts.  For example, it can be used  on
       an income account where amounts are normally displayed as negative num-
       bers.   It's  also  useful to show postings on the checking account to-
       gether with the related account:

       The --sort=FIELDS flag sorts by the fields given, which can be  any  of
       account, amount, absamount, date, or desc/description, optionally sepa-
       rated  by  commas.   For  example, --sort account,amount will group all
       transactions in each account, sorted by transaction amount.  Each field
       can be negated by a preceding -, so --sort -amount will  show  transac-
       tions ordered from smallest amount to largest amount.

              $ hledger register --related --invert assets:checking

       With a reporting interval, register shows summary postings, one per in-
       terval, aggregating the postings to each account:

              $ hledger register --monthly income
              2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
              2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2

       Periods  with no activity, and summary postings with a zero amount, are
       not shown by default; use the --empty/-E flag to see them:

              $ hledger register --monthly income -E
              2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1

       Often, you'll want to see just one line per interval.  The --depth  op-
       tion helps with this, causing subaccounts to be aggregated:

              $ hledger register --monthly assets --depth 1h
              2008/01                 assets                                  $1           $1
              2008/06                 assets                                 $-1            0
              2008/12                 assets                                 $-1          $-1

       Note  when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates these
       will be adjusted outward if necessary to contain a whole number of  in-
       tervals.   This  ensures  that  the  first  and last intervals are full
       length and comparable to the others in the report.

       With -m DESC/--match=DESC, register does a fuzzy search for one  recent
       posting whose description is most similar to DESC.  DESC should contain
       at least two characters.  If there is no similar-enough match, no post-
       ing will be shown and the program exit code will be non-zero.

   Custom register output
       register  normally  uses  the  full terminal width (or 80 columns if it
       can't detect that).  You can override this with the --width/-w option.

       The description and account columns normally share  the  space  equally
       (about half of (width - 40) each).  You can adjust this by adding a de-
       scription width as part of --width's argument, comma-separated: --width
       W,D .  Here's a diagram (won't display correctly in --help):

              <--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
              date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
              DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA

       and some examples:

              $ hledger reg                     # use terminal width (or 80 on windows)
              $ hledger reg -w 100              # use width 100
              $ hledger reg -w 100,40           # set overall width 100, description width 40

       This command also supports the output destination and output format op-
       tions  The  output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv (Added in 1.32),
       and json.

       This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and sup-
       ports  many  of  that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
       It is similar to  hledger  balance  -H  assets  liabilities,  but  with
       smarter  account  detection,  and liabilities displayed with their sign
       flipped.

       This command also supports the output destination and output format op-
       tions The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv (Added  in  1.32),
       html, and json.

       This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and sup-
       ports many of that command's features, such  as  multi-period  reports.
       It is similar to hledger balance -H assets liabilities equity, but with
       smarter  account detection, and liabilities/equity displayed with their
       sign flipped.

       This report is the easiest way to see if the accounting equation (A+L+E
       = 0) is satisfied (after you have done a close --retain to  merge  rev-
       enues  and  expenses  with  equity, and perhaps added --infer-equity to
       balance your commodity conversions).

       This command also supports the output destination and output format op-
       tions The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv, html, and json.

                -T --row-total            show a row total column (in multicolumn reports)
                   --summary-only         display only row summaries (e.g. row total,
                                          average) (in multicolumn reports)
                -N --no-total             omit the final total row
                   --no-elide             in tree mode, don't squash boring parent accounts
                   --format=FORMATSTR     use this custom line format (in simple reports)
                -S --sort-amount          sort by amount instead of account code/name (in
                                          flat mode). With multiple columns, sorts by the row
                                          total, or by row average if that is displayed.
                -% --percent              express values in percentage of each column's
                                          total
                -r --related              show the other accounts transacted with, instead
                   --invert               display all amounts with reversed sign
                   --transpose            switch rows and columns (use vertical time axis)
                   --layout=ARG           how to lay out multi-commodity amounts and the
                                          overall table:
                                          'wide[,W]': commodities on same line, up to W wide
                                          'tall'    : commodities on separate lines
                                          'bare'    : commodity symbols in a separate column
                                          'tidy'    : each data field in its own column
                   --base-url=URLPREFIX   in html output, generate links to hledger-web,
                                          with this prefix. (Usually the base url shown by
                                          hledger-web; can also be relative.)
                -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                                          txt, html, csv, tsv, json, fods.
                -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                                          one of the above formats selects that format.

       balance is one of hledger's oldest and  most  versatile  commands,  for
       listing  account  balances,  balance changes, values, value changes and
       more, during one time period or many.  Generally it shows a table, with
       rows representing accounts, and columns representing periods.

       Note there are some variants of the balance command with convenient de-
       faults, which are simpler  to  use:  balancesheet,  balancesheetequity,
       cashflow  and  incomestatement.   When  you need more control, then use
       balance.

   balance features
       Here's a quick overview of the balance command's features, followed  by
       more  detailed  descriptions and examples.  Many of these work with the
       other balance-like commands as well (bs, cf, is..).

       balance can show..

       o accounts as a list (-l) or a tree (-t)

       o optionally depth-limited (-[1-9])

       o sorted by declaration order and name, or by amount

       ..and their..

       o balance changes (the default)

       o or actual and planned balance changes (--budget)

       o or value of balance changes (-V)

       o or change of balance values (--valuechange)

       o or unrealised capital gain/loss (--gain)

       o or balance changes from sibling postings (--related/-r)

       o or postings count (--count)

       ..in..

       o one time period (the whole journal period by default)

       o or multiple periods (-D, -W, -M, -Q, -Y, -p INTERVAL)

       ..either..

       o per period (the default)

       o or accumulated since report start date (--cumulative)

       o or accumulated since account creation (--historical/-H)

       ..possibly converted to..

       o cost (--value=cost[,COMM]/--cost/-B)

       o or market value, as of transaction dates (--value=then[,COMM])

       o or at period ends (--value=end[,COMM])

       o or now (--value=now)

       o or at some other date (--value=YYYY-MM-DD)

       ..with..

       o totals (-T), averages (-A), percentages (-%),  inverted  sign  (--in-
         vert)

       o rows and columns swapped (--transpose)

       o another field used as account name (--pivot)

       o custom-formatted line items (single-period reports only) (--format)

       o commodities displayed on the same line or multiple lines (--layout)

       This command supports the output destination and output format options,
       with output formats txt, csv, tsv (Added in 1.32), json, and (multi-pe-
       riod  reports  only:)  html,  fods (Added in 1.40).  In txt output in a
       colour-supporting terminal, negative amounts are shown in red.

   Simple balance report
       With no arguments, balance shows a  list  of  all  accounts  and  their
       change  of  balance  - ie, the sum of posting amounts, both inflows and
       outflows - during the entire period of  the  journal.   ("Simple"  here
       means  just  one  column of numbers, covering a single period.  You can
       also have multi-period reports, described later.)

       For real-world accounts, these numbers will normally be their end  bal-
       ance at the end of the journal period; more on this below.

       Accounts  are  sorted  by declaration order if any, and then alphabeti-
       cally by account name.  For instance (using examples/sample.journal):

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal
                                $1  assets:bank:saving
                               $-2  assets:cash
                                $1  expenses:food
                                $1  expenses:supplies
                               $-1  income:gifts
                               $-1  income:salary
                                $1  liabilities:debts
              --------------------
                                 0

       Accounts with a zero balance (and no non-zero subaccounts, in tree mode
       - see below) are hidden by default.  Use -E/--empty to show  them  (re-
       vealing assets:bank:checking here):

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal  -E
                                 0  assets:bank:checking
                                $1  assets:bank:saving
                               $-2  assets:cash
                                $1  expenses:food
                                $1  expenses:supplies
                               $-1  income:gifts
                               $-1  income:salary
                                $1  liabilities:debts
              --------------------
                                 0

       The  total  of  the amounts displayed is shown as the last line, unless
       -N/--no-total is used.

   Balance report line format
       For single-period balance reports displayed in the terminal (only), you
       can use --format FMT to customise the format and content of each  line.
       Eg:

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal balance --format "%20(account) %12(total)"
                            assets          $-1
                       bank:saving           $1
                              cash          $-2
                          expenses           $2
                              food           $1
                          supplies           $1
                            income          $-2
                             gifts          $-1
                            salary          $-1
                 liabilities:debts           $1
              ---------------------------------
                                              0

       The  FMT  format  string  specifies  the formatting applied to each ac-
       count/balance pair.  It may contain any suitable text, with data fields
       interpolated like so:

       %[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)

       o MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)

       o MAX truncates at this width (optional)

       o FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:

         o depth_spacer - a number of spaces equal to the account's depth,  or
           if MIN is specified, MIN * depth spaces.

         o account - the account's name

         o total - the account's balance/posted total, right justified

       Also,  FMT  can begin with an optional prefix to control how multi-com-
       modity amounts are rendered:

       o %_ - render on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)

       o %^ - render on multiple lines, top-aligned

       o %, - render on one line, comma-separated

       There are some quirks.  Eg in one-line mode, %(depth_spacer) has no ef-
       fect, instead %(account) has indentation  built  in.    Experimentation
       may be needed to get pleasing results.

       Some example formats:

       o %(total) - the account's total

       o %-20.20(account)  -  the account's name, left justified, padded to 20
         characters and clipped at 20 characters

       o %,%-50(account)  %25(total) - account name padded to  50  characters,
         total  padded to 20 characters, with multiple commodities rendered on
         one line

       o %20(total)  %2(depth_spacer)%-(account) - the default format for  the
         single-column balance report

   Filtered balance report
       You  can  show  fewer  accounts,  a  different time period, totals from
       cleared transactions only, etc.  by using query arguments or options to
       limit the postings being matched.  Eg:

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal --cleared assets date:200806
                               $-2  assets:cash
              --------------------
                               $-2

   List or tree mode
       By default, or with -l/--flat, accounts are shown as a flat  list  with
       their full names visible, as in the examples above.

       With  -t/--tree,  the  account  hierarchy  is  shown, with subaccounts'
       "leaf" names indented below their parent:

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal balance
                               $-1  assets
                                $1    bank:saving
                               $-2    cash
                                $2  expenses
                                $1    food
                                $1    supplies
                               $-2  income
                               $-1    gifts
                               $-1    salary
                                $1  liabilities:debts
              --------------------
                                 0

       Notes:

       o "Boring" accounts are combined with their subaccount for more compact
         output, unless --no-elide is used.  Boring accounts have  no  balance
         of  their own and just one subaccount (eg assets:bank and liabilities
         above).

       o All balances shown are "inclusive", ie including  the  balances  from
         all  subaccounts.   Note  this  means  some repetition in the output,
         which requires explanation when sharing reports with non-plaintextac-
         counting-users.  A tree mode report's final total is the sum  of  the
         top-level balances shown, not of all the balances shown.

       o Each  group of sibling accounts (ie, under a common parent) is sorted
         separately.

   Depth limiting
       With a depth:NUM query, or --depth NUM option, or just  -NUM  (eg:  -3)
       balance  reports will show accounts only to the specified depth, hiding
       the deeper subaccounts.  This can be useful  for  getting  an  overview
       without too much detail.

       Account  balances  at  the depth limit always include the balances from
       any deeper subaccounts (even in list mode).  Eg, limiting to depth 1:

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal balance -1
                               $-1  assets
                                $2  expenses
                               $-2  income
                                $1  liabilities
              --------------------
                                 0

   Dropping top-level accounts
       You can also hide one or  more  top-level  account  name  parts,  using
       --drop NUM.  This can be useful for hiding repetitive top-level account
       names:

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal expenses --drop 1
                                $1  food
                                $1  supplies
              --------------------
                                $2

   Showing declared accounts
       With  --declared, accounts which have been declared with an account di-
       rective will be included in the balance report, even if  they  have  no
       transactions.  (Since they will have a zero balance, you will also need
       -E/--empty to see them.)

       More  precisely,  leaf  declared accounts (with no subaccounts) will be
       included, since those are usually the more useful in reports.

       The idea of this is to be able to see a useful "complete"  balance  re-
       port, even when you don't have transactions in all of your declared ac-
       counts yet.

   Sorting by amount
       With  -S/--sort-amount,  accounts with the largest (most positive) bal-
       ances are shown first.   Eg:  hledger  bal  expenses  -MAS  shows  your
       biggest  averaged monthly expenses first.  When more than one commodity
       is present, they will be sorted by the alphabetically earliest  commod-
       ity  first, and then by subsequent commodities (if an amount is missing
       a commodity, it is treated as 0).

       Revenues and liability balances are typically negative, however, so  -S
       shows  these  in reverse order.  To work around this, you can add --in-
       vert to flip the signs.  Or you could use one of the higher-level  bal-
       ance reports (bs, is..), which flip the sign automatically (eg: hledger
       is -MAS).

   Percentages
       With  -%/--percent, balance reports show each account's value expressed
       as a percentage of the (column) total.

       Note it is not useful to calculate percentages if the amounts in a col-
       umn have mixed signs.  In this case, make a separate  report  for  each
       sign, eg:

              $ hledger bal -% amt:`>0`
              $ hledger bal -% amt:`<0`

       Similarly,  if  the amounts in a column have mixed commodities, convert
       them to one commodity with -B, -V, -X or --value, or  make  a  separate
       report for each commodity:

              $ hledger bal -% cur:\\$
              $ hledger bal -% cur:

   Multi-period balance report
       With   a   report   interval   (set  by  the  -D/--daily,  -W/--weekly,
       -M/--monthly, -Q/--quarterly, -Y/--yearly, or -p/--period  flag),  bal-
       ance  shows a tabular report, with columns representing successive time
       periods (and a title):

              $ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal --quarterly income expenses -E
              Balance changes in 2008:

                                 ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4
              ===================++=================================
               expenses:food     ||       0      $1       0       0
               expenses:supplies ||       0      $1       0       0
               income:gifts      ||       0     $-1       0       0
               income:salary     ||     $-1       0       0       0
              -------------------++---------------------------------
                                 ||     $-1      $1       0       0

       Notes:

       o The report's start/end dates will be expanded, if necessary, to fully
         encompass the displayed subperiods (so that the first and last subpe-
         riods have the same duration as the others).

       o Leading and trailing periods (columns) containing all zeroes are  not
         shown, unless -E/--empty is used.

       o Accounts   (rows)   containing  all  zeroes  are  not  shown,  unless
         -E/--empty is used.

       o Amounts with many commodities are shown in abbreviated  form,  unless
         --no-elide is used.

       o Average  and/or  total columns can be added with the -A/--average and
         -T/--row-total flags.

       o The --transpose flag can be used to exchange rows and columns.

       o The --pivot FIELD option causes a different transaction field  to  be
         used as "account name".  See PIVOTING.

       o The  --summary-only flag (--summary also works) hides all but the To-
         tal and Average columns (those should be enabled with --row-total and
         -A/--average).

       Multi-period reports with many periods can be too wide for easy viewing
       in the terminal.  Here are some ways to handle that:

       o Hide the totals row with -N/--no-total

       o Filter to a single currency with cur:

       o Convert to a single currency with -V [--infer-market-price]

       o Use a more compact layout like --layout=bare

       o Maximize the terminal window

       o Reduce the terminal's font size

       o View with a pager like less, eg: hledger bal -D  --color=yes  |  less

   Balance change, end balance
       It's important to be clear on the meaning of the numbers shown in  bal-
       ance reports.  Here is some terminology we use:

       A  balance  change  is the net amount added to, or removed from, an ac-
       count during some period.

       An end balance is the amount accumulated in an account as of some  date
       (and  some  time,  but hledger doesn't store that; assume end of day in
       your timezone).  It is the sum of previous balance changes.

       We call it a historical end balance if it includes all balance  changes
       since the account was created.  For a real world account, this means it
       will  match  the  "historical record", eg the balances reported in your
       bank statements or bank web UI.  (If they are correct!)

       In general, balance changes are what you want  to  see  when  reviewing
       revenues and expenses, and historical end balances are what you want to
       see when reviewing or reconciling asset, liability and equity accounts.

       balance  shows  balance changes by default.  To see accurate historical
       end balances:

       1. Initialise account starting  balances  with  an  "opening  balances"
          transaction  (a  transfer  from  equity  to the account), unless the
          journal covers the account's full lifetime.

       2. Include all of of the account's prior postings in the report, by not
          specifying a report start date,  or  by  using  the  -H/--historical
          flag.  (-H causes report start date to be ignored when summing post-
          ings.)

   Balance report modes
       The  balance  command is quite flexible; here is the full detail on how
       to control what it reports.  If the following seems complicated,  don't
       worry  -  this is for advanced reporting, and it does take time and ex-
       perimentation to get familiar with all the report modes.

       There are three important option groups:

       hledger balance  [CALCULATIONMODE]  [ACCUMULATIONMODE]  [VALUATIONMODE]
       ...

   Calculation mode
       The basic calculation to perform for each table cell.  It is one of:

       o --sum : sum the posting amounts (default)

       o --budget : sum the amounts, but also show the budget goal amount (for
         each account/period)

       o --valuechange : show the change in period-end historical balance val-
         ues  (caused  by  deposits, withdrawals, and/or market price fluctua-
         tions)

       o --gain : show the unrealised capital gain/loss, (the  current  valued
         balance minus each amount's original cost)

       o --count : show the count of postings

   Accumulation mode
       How  amounts  should  accumulate  across a report's subperiods/columns.
       Another way to say it: which time period's postings  should  contribute
       to each cell's calculation.  It is one of:

       o --change  :  calculate with postings from column start to column end,
         ie "just this column".   Typically  used  to  see  revenues/expenses.
         (default for balance, cashflow, incomestatement)

       o --cumulative  :  calculate  with postings from report start to column
         end, ie "previous columns plus this column".  Typically used to  show
         changes accumulated since the report's start date.  Not often used.

       o --historical/-H  : calculate with postings from journal start to col-
         umn end, ie "all postings from before report start  date  until  this
         column's  end".  Typically used to see historical end balances of as-
         sets/liabilities/equity.  (default for  balancesheet,  balancesheete-
         quity)

   Valuation mode
       Which  kind  of value or cost conversion should be applied, if any, be-
       fore displaying the report.  See Cost reporting and Value reporting for
       more about conversions.

       A valuation (or cost) mode can be selected with the --value option:

       o no conversion : don't convert to cost or value (default)

       o --value=cost[,COMM] : convert amounts to  cost  (then  optionally  to
         some other commodity)

       o --value=then[,COMM]  : convert amounts to market value on transaction
         dates

       o --value=end[,COMM] : convert amounts to market value  on  period  end
         date(s)
       (default with --valuechange, --gain)

       o --value=now[,COMM] : convert amounts to market value on today's date

       o --value=YYYY-MM-DD[,COMM]  :  convert  amounts to market value on an-
         other date

       or with the legacy -B/-V/-X options, which are equivalent and easier to
       type:

       o -B/--cost : like --value=cost

       o -V/--market : like --value=end

       o -X COMM/--exchange COMM : like --value=end,COMM

       Note that --value can also convert to cost, as a convenience; but actu-
       ally --cost and --value are independent options, and could be used  to-
       gether.

   Combining balance report modes
       Most combinations of these modes should produce reasonable reports, but
       if  you  find any that seem wrong or misleading, let us know.  The fol-
       lowing restrictions are applied:

       o --valuechange implies --value=end

       o --valuechange makes --change the default  when  used  with  the  bal-
         ancesheet/balancesheetequity commands

       o --cumulative or --historical disables --row-total/-T

       For reference, here is what the combinations of accumulation and valua-
       tion show:

       Valua-     no valuation       --value= then       --value= end      --value=
       tion:>                                                              YYYY-MM-DD
       Accumu-                                                             /now

                  ance)              riod end            end

   Budget report
       The --budget report is like a regular balance report, but with two main
       differences:

       o Budget goals and performance percentages are also shown, in brackets

       o Accounts which don't have budget goals are hidden by default.

       This is useful for comparing planned and actual income, expenses,  time
       usage, etc.

       Periodic  transaction rules are used to define budget goals.  For exam-
       ple, here's a periodic rule defining monthly goals for bus  travel  and
       food expenses:

              ;; Budget
              ~ monthly
                (expenses:bus)              $30
                (expenses:food)            $400

       After recording some actual expenses,

              ;; Two months worth of expenses
              2017-11-01
                income                   $-1950
                expenses:bus                $35
                expenses:food:groceries    $310
                expenses:food:dining        $42
                expenses:movies             $38
                assets:bank:checking

              2017-12-01
                income                   $-2100
                expenses:bus                $53
                expenses:food:groceries    $380
                expenses:food:dining        $32
                expenses:gifts             $100
                assets:bank:checking

       we can see a budget report like this:

              $ hledger bal -M --budget
              Budget performance in 2017-11-01..2017-12-31:

              ===============++============================================
               <unbudgeted>  || $-425                 $-565
               expenses      ||  $425 [ 99% of $430]   $565 [131% of $430]
               expenses:bus  ||   $35 [117% of  $30]    $53 [177% of  $30]
               expenses:food ||  $352 [ 88% of $400]   $412 [103% of $400]

       This is "goal-based budgeting"; you define goals for accounts and peri-
       ods,  often  recurring,  and  hledger shows performance relative to the
       goals.  This contrasts with "envelope budgeting",  which  is  more  de-
       tailed  and  strict  -  useful when cash is tight, but also quite a bit
       more work.  https://plaintextaccounting.org/Budgeting has more on  this
       topic.

   Using the budget report
       Historically  this  report  has  been confusing and fragile.  hledger's
       version should be relatively robust and intuitive, but  you  may  still
       find  surprises.   Here  are more notes to help with learning and trou-
       bleshooting.

       o In the above example, expenses:bus and expenses:food  are  shown  be-
         cause they have budget goals during the report period.

       o Their  parent  expenses  is  also shown, with budget goals aggregated
         from the children.

       o The subaccounts expenses:food:groceries and expenses:food:dining  are
         not  shown since they have no budget goal of their own, but they con-
         tribute to expenses:food's actual amount.

       o Unbudgeted accounts expenses:movies and expenses:gifts are  also  not
         shown, but they contribute to expenses's actual amount.

       o The  other  unbudgeted  accounts  income and assets:bank:checking are
         grouped as <unbudgeted>.

       o --depth or depth: can be used to limit report depth in the usual  way
         (but will not reveal unbudgeted subaccounts).

       o Amounts are always inclusive of subaccounts (even in -l/--list mode).

       o Numbers displayed in a --budget report will not always agree with the
         totals,  because  of  hidden  unbudgeted  accounts;  this  is normal.
         -E/--empty can be used to reveal the hidden accounts.

       o In the periodic rules used for setting budget goals, unbalanced post-
         ings are convenient.

       o You can filter budget reports with the usual queries, eg to focus  on
         particular  accounts.  It's common to restrict them to just expenses.
         (The <unbudgeted> account is occasionally hard to  exclude;  this  is
         because of date surprises, discussed below.)

       o When  you  have  multiple currencies, you may want to convert them to
         one (-X COMM --infer-market-prices) and/or show just one  at  a  time
         (cur:COMM).   If  you  do  need  to show multiple currencies at once,
         --layout bare can be helpful.

       o You can "roll over" amounts (actual and budgeted) to the next  period
         with --cumulative.

       See also: https://hledger.org/budgeting.html.

   Budget date surprises
       With  small  data,  or  when starting out, some of the generated budget
       goal transaction dates might fall outside the report periods.  Eg  with
       the  following  journal and report, the first period appears to have no
       expenses:food budget.  (Also the <unbudgeted>  account  should  be  ex-
       cluded by the expenses query, but isn't.):

              ~ monthly in 2020
                (expenses:food)  $500

              2020-01-15
                expenses:food    $400
                assets:checking

              $ hledger bal --budget expenses
              Budget performance in 2020-01-15:

                             ||         2020-01-15
              ===============++====================
               <unbudgeted>  || $400
               expenses:food ||    0 [ 0% of $500]
              ---------------++--------------------
                             || $400 [80% of $500]

       In  this case, the budget goal transactions are generated on first days
       of of month (this can be seen with hledger print --forecast  tag:gener-
       ated  expenses).   Whereas  the report period defaults to just the 15th
       day of january (this can be seen from the report table's  column  head-
       ings).

       To  fix  this  kind  of thing, be more explicit about the report period
       (and/or the periodic rules' dates).  In this case, adding -b 2020  does
       the trick.

   Selecting budget goals
       By  default,  the budget report uses all available periodic transaction
       rules to generate goals.  This includes rules with a  different  report
       interval  from  your  report.  Eg if you have daily, weekly and monthly
       periodic rules, all of these will contribute to the goals in a  monthly
       budget report.

       You  can  select a subset of periodic rules by providing an argument to
       the --budget flag.  --budget=DESCPAT  will  match  all  periodic  rules
       whose description contains DESCPAT, a case-insensitive substring (not a
       regular  expression  or  query).  This means you can give your periodic
       rules descriptions (remember that two spaces are needed between  period
       expression  and description), and then select from multiple budgets de-
       fined in your journal.

   Budgeting vs forecasting
       --forecast and --budget both use the periodic transaction rules in  the
       journal  to  generate  temporary  transactions  for reporting purposes.
       However they are separate features - though you can  use  both  at  the
       same time if you want.  Here are some differences between them:

       --forecast                               --budget
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                uses  just  the rules matched by
                                                DESCPAT

   Balance report layout
       The --layout option affects how balance and the other balance-like com-
       mands show multi-commodity amounts and commodity symbols.  It  can  im-
       prove readability, for humans and/or machines (other software).  It has
       four possible values:

       o --layout=wide[,WIDTH]:  commodities  are  shown on a single line, op-
         tionally elided to WIDTH

       o --layout=tall: each commodity is shown on a separate line

       o --layout=bare: commodity symbols are in their own column, amounts are
         bare numbers

       o --layout=tidy: data is normalised  to  easily-consumed  "tidy"  form,
         with  one  row per data value.  (This one is currently supported only
         by the balance command.)

       Here are the --layout modes supported by each output  format  Only  CSV
       output supports all of them:

       -      txt   csv   html   json   sql
       -------------------------------------
       wide   Y     Y     Y
       tall   Y     Y     Y
       bare   Y     Y     Y
       tidy         Y

       Examples:

   Wide layout
       With many commodities, reports can be very wide:

       Bare layout also affects CSV output, which is useful for producing data
       that is easier to consume, eg for making charts:

              $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -O csv --layout=bare
              "account","commodity","balance"
              "Assets:US:ETrade","GLD","70.00"
              "Assets:US:ETrade","ITOT","17.00"
              "Assets:US:ETrade","USD","5120.50"
              "Assets:US:ETrade","VEA","36.00"
              "Assets:US:ETrade","VHT","294.00"
              "Total:","GLD","70.00"
              "Total:","ITOT","17.00"
              "Total:","USD","5120.50"
              "Total:","VEA","36.00"
              "Total:","VHT","294.00"

       Bare  layout will sometimes display an extra row for the no-symbol com-
       modity, because of zero  amounts  (hledger  treats  zeroes  as  commod-
       ity-less,   usually).    This   can   break   hledger-bar   confusingly
       (workaround: add a cur: query to exclude the no-symbol row).

   Tidy layout
       This       produces       normalised       "tidy       data"       (see
       https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
       where  every variable has its own column and each row represents a sin-
       gle data point.  This is the easiest kind of data for other software to
       consume:

              $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -Y -O csv --layout=tidy

   Balance report output
       As noted in Output format, if you choose HTML output (by using -O  html
       or -o somefile.html), you can create a hledger.css file in the same di-
       rectory to customise the report's appearance.

       The  HTML  and  FODS  output  formats  can  generate  hyperlinks  to  a
       hledger-web register view for each account and period.  E.g.   if  your
       hledger-web server is reachable at http://localhost:5000 then you might
       run  the balance command with the extra option --base-url=http://local-
       host:5000.    You   can   also    produce    relative    links,    like
       --base-url="some/path" or --base-url="".)

   Some useful balance reports
       Some frequently used balance options/reports are:

       o bal -M revenues expenses
       Show  revenues/expenses  in each month.  Also available as the incomes-
       tatement command.

       o bal -M -H assets liabilities
       Show historical asset/liability  balances  at  each  month  end.   Also
       available as the balancesheet command.

       o bal -M -H assets liabilities equity
       Show  historical  asset/liability/equity  balances  at  each month end.
       Also available as the balancesheetequity command.

       o bal -M assets not:receivable
       Show changes to liquid assets in each month.   Also  available  as  the
       cashflow command.

       Also:

       o bal -M expenses -2 -SA
       Show  monthly  expenses  summarised  to  depth  2 and sorted by average
       amount.

       o bal -M --budget expenses
       Show monthly expenses and budget goals.

       o bal -M --valuechange investments
       Show monthly change in market value of investment assets.

       o bal  investments  --valuechange  -D  date:lastweek  amt:'>1000'  -STA
         [--invert]
       Show top gainers [or losers] last week

   roi
       Shows  the  time-weighted (TWR) and money-weighted (IRR) rate of return
       on your investments.

              Flags:
                   --cashflow                 show all amounts that were used to compute
                                              returns
                   --investment=QUERY         query to select your investment transactions
                   --profit-loss=QUERY --pnl  query to select profit-and-loss or
                                              appreciation/valuation transactions

       At a minimum, you need to supply a query (which could be  just  an  ac-
       count  name) to select your investment(s) with --inv, and another query
       to identify your profit and loss transactions with --pnl.

       If you do not record changes in the value of your investment  manually,
       or  do  not  require  computation  of time-weighted return (TWR), --pnl
       could be an empty query (--pnl "" or --pnl STR where STR does not match
       any of your accounts).

       This command will compute and display the internalized rate  of  return
       (IRR,  also  known  as money-weighted rate of return) and time-weighted
       rate of return (TWR) for your  investments  for  the  time  period  re-
       quested.   IRR  is always annualized due to the way it is computed, but
       TWR is reported both as a rate over the chosen reporting period and  as
       an annual rate.

       Price  directives  will be taken into account if you supply appropriate
       --cost or --value flags (see VALUATION).

       Note, in some cases this report can fail, for these reasons:

       o Error (NotBracketed): No solution for Internal Rate of Return  (IRR).
         Possible  causes:  IRR is huge (>1000000%), balance of investment be-
         comes negative at some point in time.

       o Error (SearchFailed): Failed to find solution for  Internal  Rate  of
         Return (IRR).  Either search does not converge to a solution, or con-
         verges too slowly.

       Examples:

       o Using   roi   to  compute  total  return  of  investment  in  stocks:
         https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/examples/invest-
         ing/roi-unrealised.ledger

       o Cookbook > Return on Investment: https://hledger.org/roi.html

   Spaces and special characters in --inv and --pnl
       Note that --inv and --pnl's argument is a query, and queries could have
       several space-separated terms (see QUERIES).

       To indicate that all search terms form  single  command-line  argument,
       you will need to put them in quotes (see Special characters):

              $ hledger roi --inv 'term1 term2 term3 ...'

       If  any  query  terms contain spaces themselves, you will need an extra
       level of nested quoting, eg:

              $ hledger roi --inv="'Assets:Test 1'" --pnl="'Equity:Unrealized Profit and Loss'"

   Semantics of --inv and --pnl
       Query supplied to --inv has to match all transactions that are  related
       to your investment.  Transactions not matching --inv will be ignored.

       In these transactions, ROI will conside postings that match --inv to be
       "investment  postings"  and other postings (not matching --inv) will be
       sorted into two categories: "cash flow" and "profit and loss",  as  ROI
       needs  to know which part of the investment value is your contributions
       and which is due to the return on investment.

       o "Cash flow" is depositing or withdrawing money, buying or selling as-
         sets, or otherwise converting between your investment  commodity  and
         any other commodity.  Example:

                2019-01-01 Investing in Snake Oil
                  assets:cash          -$100
                  investment:snake oil

                2020-01-01 Selling my Snake Oil
                  assets:cash           $10
                  investment:snake oil  = 0

       o "Profit and loss" is change in the value of your investment:

                2019-06-01 Snake Oil falls in value
                  investment:snake oil  = $57
                  equity:unrealized profit or loss

       All  non-investment postings are assumed to be "cash flow", unless they
       match --pnl query.  Changes in value of your investment due to  "profit
       and  loss"  postings  will be considered as part of your investment re-
       turn.

       Example: if you use --inv snake --pnl equity:unrealized, then  postings
       in the example below would be classifed as:

              2019-01-01 Snake Oil #1
                assets:cash          -$100   ; cash flow posting
                investment:snake oil         ; investment posting

              2019-03-01 Snake Oil #2
                equity:unrealized pnl  -$100 ; profit and loss posting
                snake oil                    ; investment posting

              2019-07-01 Snake Oil #3
                equity:unrealized pnl        ; profit and loss posting
                cash          -$100          ; cash flow posting
                snake oil     $50            ; investment posting

   IRR and TWR explained
       "ROI"  stands  for "return on investment".  Traditionally this was com-
       puted as a difference between current value of investment and its  ini-
       tial value, expressed in percentage of the initial value.

       However, this approach is only practical in simple cases, where invest-
       ments  receives  no  in-flows  or out-flows of money, and where rate of
       growth is fixed over time.  For more complex scenarios you need differ-
       ent ways to compute rate of return, and this command implements two  of
       them: IRR and TWR.

       Internal  rate of return, or "IRR" (also called "money-weighted rate of
       return") takes into account effects of in-flows and out-flows, and  the
       time  between  them.  Investment at a particular fixed interest rate is
       going to give you more interest than the same amount  invested  at  the
       same  interest  rate,  but  made later in time.  If you are withdrawing
       from your investment, your future gains would be smaller  (in  absolute
       numbers),  and will be a smaller percentage of your initial investment,
       so your IRR will be smaller.  And if you are adding to your investment,
       you will receive bigger absolute gains, which will be a bigger percent-
       age of your initial investment, so your IRR will be larger.

       As mentioned before, in-flows and out-flows would be any cash that  you
       personally put in or withdraw, and for the "roi" command, these are the
       postings  that  match  the query in the--inv argument and NOT match the
       query in the--pnl argument.

       If you manually record changes in  the  value  of  your  investment  as
       transactions  that  balance them against "profit and loss" (or "unreal-
       ized gains") account or use price directives, then in order for IRR  to
       compute  the  precise effect of your in-flows and out-flows on the rate
       of return, you will need to record the value of your investement on  or
       close to the days when in- or out-flows occur.

       In  technical  terms,  IRR uses the same approach as computation of net
       present value, and tries to find a discount rate that makes net present
       value of all the cash flows of your investment to add up to zero.  This
       could be hard to wrap your head around, especially if you haven't  done
       discounted cash flow analysis before.  Implementation of IRR in hledger
       should produce results that match the =XIRR formula in Excel.

       Second  way  to  compute  rate of return that roi command implements is
       called "time-weighted rate of return" or "TWR".  Like IRR, it will  ac-
       count  for the effect of your in-flows and out-flows, but unlike IRR it
       will try to compute the true rate of return of  the  underlying  asset,
       compensating  for  the  effect that deposits and withdrawas have on the
       apparent rate of growth of your investment.

       TWR represents your  investment  as  an  imaginary  "unit  fund"  where
       in-flows/  out-flows  lead to buying or selling "units" of your invest-
       ment and changes in its value change the value  of  "investment  unit".
       Change  in "unit price" over the reporting period gives you rate of re-
       turn of your investment, and make TWR less sensitive than  IRR  to  the
       effects of cash in-flows and out-flows.

       default).  With query arguments, it counts only matched transactions.

       Examples:

              $ hledger activity --quarterly
              2008-01-01 **
              2008-04-01 *******

Data generation commands
   close
       (equity)

       close prints several kinds of "closing" and/or "opening"  transactions,
       useful in various situations: migrating balances to a new journal file,
       retaining  earnings  into  equity,  consolidating balances, viewing lot
       costs..  Like print, it prints valid journal  entries.   You  can  copy
       these into your journal file(s) when you are happy with how they look.

              Flags:
                   --clopen[=TAGVAL]      show closing and opening balances transactions,
                                          for AL accounts by default
                   --close[=TAGVAL]       show just a closing balances transaction
                   --open[=TAGVAL]        show just an opening balances transaction
                   --assert[=TAGVAL]      show a balance assertions transaction
                   --assign[=TAGVAL]      show a balance assignments transaction
                   --retain[=TAGVAL]      show a retain earnings transaction, for RX
                                          accounts by default
                -x --explicit             show all amounts explicitly
                   --show-costs           show amounts with different costs separately
                   --interleaved          show source and destination postings together
                   --assertion-type=TYPE  =, ==, =* or ==*
                   --close-desc=DESC      set closing transaction's description
                   --close-acct=ACCT      set closing transaction's destination account
                   --open-desc=DESC       set opening transaction's description
                   --open-acct=ACCT       set opening transaction's source account
                   --round=TYPE           how much rounding or padding should be done when
                                          displaying amounts ?
                                          none - show original decimal digits,
                                                 as in journal (default)
                                          soft - just add or remove decimal zeros
                                                 to match precision
                                          hard - round posting amounts to precision
                                                 (can unbalance transactions)
                                          all  - also round cost amounts to precision
                                                 (can unbalance transactions)

       close  has  six  modes,  selected  by  choosing  one  of the mode flags
       (--close is the default).  They all do much  the  same  operation,  but
       with different defaults, useful in different situations.

   close --clopen
       This is useful if migrating balances to a new journal file at the start
       of  a new year.  It prints a "closing balances" transaction that zeroes
       out account balances (Asset and Liability accounts, by default), and an
       opposite "opening balances" transaction that restores them again.  Typ-
       ically, you would run

              hledger close --clopen -e NEWYEAR >> $LEDGER_FILE

       and then move the opening transaction from the old file to the new file
       (and probably also update your LEDGER_FILE environment variable).

       Why might you do this ?  If your reports are fast, you may not need it.
       But at some point you will probably want  to  partition  your  data  by
       time,  for  performance or data integrity or regulatory reasons.  A new
       file or set of files per year is common.  Then, having each  file/file-
       set  "bookended" with opening and closing balance transactions will al-
       low you to freely pick and choose which files to read - just  the  cur-
       rent year, any past year, any sequence of years, or all of them - while
       showing  correct  account  balances in each case.  The earliest opening
       balances transaction sets correct  starting  balances,  and  any  later
       closing/opening pairs will harmlessly cancel each other out.

       The  balances  will  be  transferred to and from equity:opening/closing
       balances by default.  You  can  override  this  by  using  --close-acct
       and/or --open-acct.

       You  can  select a different set of accounts to close/open by providing
       an account query.  Eg to add Equity accounts,  provide  arguments  like
       assets  liabilities  equity or type:ALE.  When migrating to a new file,
       you'll usually want to bring along the AL or ALE accounts, but not  the
       RX accounts (Revenue, Expense).

       Assertions  will  be  added indicating and checking the new balances of
       the closed/opened accounts.

       The generated transactions will have a clopen: tag.  If the main  jour-
       nal's  base  file  name contains a number (eg a year number), the tag's
       value will be that base file name with the number incremented.  Or  you
       can choose the tag value yourself, by using --clopen=TAGVAL.

   close --close
       This  prints  just the closing balances transaction of --clopen.  It is
       the default if you don't specify a mode.

       More customisation options are described below.   Among  other  things,
       you can use close --close to generate a transaction moving the balances
       from any set of accounts, to a different account.  (If you need to move
       just a portion of the balance, see hledger-move.)

   close --open
       This  prints just the opening balances transaction of --clopen.  (It is
       similar to Ledger's equity command.)

   close --assert
       This prints a transaction that asserts the account balances as they are
       on the end date (and adds an assert: tag).  It could be useful as docu-
       mention and to guard against changes.

   close --assign
       This prints a transaction that assigns the account balances as they are
       on the end date (and adds an "assign:"  tag).   Unlike  balance  asser-
       tions, assignments will post changes to balances as needed to reach the
       specified amounts.

       This  is  another  way to set starting balances when migrating to a new
       file, and it will set them correctly even in the  presence  of  earlier
       files  which  do  not have a closing balances transaction.  However, it
       can hide errors, and disturb the accounting equation,  so  --clopen  is
       usually recommended.

   close --retain
       This  is  like  --close, but it closes Revenue and Expense account bal-
       ances by default.  They will be transferred  to  equity:retained  earn-
       ings, or another account specified with --close-acct.

       Revenues  and expenses correspond to changes in equity.  They are cate-
       gorised separately for reporting purposes, but traditionally at the end
       of each accounting period, businesses  consolidate  them  into  equity,
       This is called "retaining earnings", or "closing the books".

       In  personal  accounting,  there's not much reason to do this, and most
       people don't.  (One reason to do it is to help  the  balancesheetequity
       report  show  a  zero total, demonstrating that the accounting equation
       (A-L=E) is satisfied.)

   close customisation
       In all modes, the following things can be overridden:

       o the accounts to be closed/opened, with account query arguments

       o the balancing account, with --close-acct=ACCT and/or --open-acct=ACCT

       o the   transaction   descriptions,    with    --close-desc=DESC    and
         --open-desc=DESC

       o the transaction's tag value, with a --MODE=NEW option argument

       o the closing/opening dates, with -e OPENDATE

       By  default,  the closing date is yesterday, or the journal's end date,
       whichever is later; and the opening date is always one  day  after  the
       closing  date.   You  can change these by specifying a report end date;
       the closing date will be the last day of the report period.  Eg -e 2024
       means "close on 2023-12-31, open on 2024-01-01".

       With --x/--explicit, the balancing amount will be shown explicitly, and
       if it involves multiple commodities, a separate posting will be  gener-
       ated for each of them (similar to print -x).

       With  --interleaved,  each individual transfer is shown with source and
       destination postings next to  each  other  (perhaps  useful  for  trou-
       bleshooting).

       With --show-costs, balances' costs are also shown, with different costs
       kept  separate.   This  may generate very large journal entries, if you
       have many  currency  conversions  or  investment  transactions.   close
       --show-costs  is  currently  the  best way to view investment lots with
       hledger.   (To  move  or  dispose  of  lots,  see  the   more   capable
       hledger-move script.)

   close and balance assertions
       close adds balance assertions verifying that the accounts have been re-
       set to zero in a closing transaction or restored to their previous bal-
       ances  in an opening transaction.  These provide useful error checking,
       but you can ignore them temporarily with -I, or remove them if you pre-
       fer.

       Single-commodity, subaccount-exclusive balance assertions (=) are  gen-
       erated  by  default.   This  can be changed with --assertion-type='==*'
       (eg).

       When running close you should probably  avoid  using  -C,  -R,  status:
       (filtering  by  status  or  realness)  or --auto (generating postings),
       since the generated balance assertions would then require these.

       Transactions with multiple dates (eg posting dates) spanning  the  file
       boundary also can disrupt the balance assertions:

              2023-12-30 a purchase made in december, cleared in january
                  expenses:food          5
                  assets:bank:checking  -5  ; date: 2023-01-02

       To  solve  this  you can transfer the money to and from a temporary ac-
       count, splitting the multi-day transaction into two single-day transac-
       tions:

              ; in 2022.journal:
              2022-12-30 a purchase made in december, cleared in january
                  expenses:food          5
                  equity:pending        -5

              ; in 2023.journal:
              2023-01-02 last year's transaction cleared
                  equity:pending         5 = 0
                  assets:bank:checking  -5

   close examples
   Retain earnings
       Record 2022's revenues/expenses as retained earnings on 2022-12-31, ap-
       pending the generated transaction to the journal:

              $ hledger close --retain -f 2022.journal -p 2022 >> 2022.journal

       After this, to see 2022's revenues and expenses you  must  exclude  the
       retain earnings transaction:

              $ hledger -f 2022.journal is not:desc:'retain earnings'

   Migrate balances to a new file
       Close assets/liabilities on 2022-12-31 and re-open them on 2023-01-01:

              $ hledger close --clopen -f 2022.journal -p 2022
              # copy/paste the closing transaction to the end of 2022.journal
              # copy/paste the opening transaction to the start of 2023.journal

       After  this,  to  see  2022's end-of-year balances you must exclude the
       closing balances transaction:

              $ hledger -f 2022.journal bs not:desc:'closing balances'

       For more flexibility, it helps to tag closing and opening  transactions
       with eg clopen:NEWYEAR, then you can ensure correct balances by exclud-
       ing all opening/closing transactions except the first, like so:

              $ hledger bs -Y -f 2021.j -f 2022.j -f 2023.j expr:'tag:clopen=2021 or not tag:clopen'
              $ hledger bs -Y -f 2021.j -f 2022.j           expr:'tag:clopen=2021 or not tag:clopen'
              $ hledger bs -Y -f 2022.j -f 2023.j           expr:'tag:clopen=2022 or not tag:clopen'
              $ hledger bs -Y -f 2021.j                     expr:'tag:clopen=2021 or not tag:clopen'
              $ hledger bs -Y -f 2022.j                     expr:'tag:clopen=2022 or not tag:clopen'
              $ hledger bs -Y -f 2023.j                     # unclosed file, no query needed

   rewrite
       Print all transactions, rewriting the postings of matched transactions.
       For  now  the only rewrite available is adding new postings, like print
       --auto.

              Flags:
                   --add-posting='ACCT  AMTEXPR'  add a posting to ACCT, which may be
                                                  parenthesised. AMTEXPR is either a literal
                                                  amount, or *N which means the transaction's
                                                  first matched amount multiplied by N (a
                                                  decimal number). Two spaces separate ACCT
                                                  and AMTEXPR.
                   --diff                         generate diff suitable as an input for
                                                  patch tool

       This is a start at a generic rewriter of transaction entries.  It reads
       the default journal and prints the transactions, like print,  but  adds
       one or more specified postings to any transactions matching QUERY.  The
       posting  amounts can be fixed, or a multiplier of the existing transac-
       tion's first posting amount.

       Examples:

              $ hledger-rewrite.hs ^income --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33  ; income tax' --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  $100'
              $ hledger-rewrite.hs expenses:gifts --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  *-1"'
              $ hledger-rewrite.hs -f rewrites.hledger

       rewrites.hledger may consist of entries like:

              = ^income amt:<0 date:2017
                (liabilities:tax)  *0.33  ; tax on income
                (reserve:grocery)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery
                (reserve:)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery

       Note the single quotes to protect the dollar sign from  bash,  and  the
       two spaces between account and amount.

       More:

              $ hledger rewrite -- [QUERY]        --add-posting "ACCT  AMTEXPR" ...
              $ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'
              $ hledger rewrite -- expenses:gifts --add-posting '(budget:gifts)  *-1"'
              $ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(budget:foreign currency)  *0.25 JPY; diversify'

       Argument  for  --add-posting  option  is a usual posting of transaction
       with an exception for amount specification.  More  precisely,  you  can
       use '*' (star symbol) before the amount to indicate that that this is a
       factor  for  an  amount of original matched posting.  If the amount in-
       cludes a commodity name, the new posting amount will be in the new com-
       modity; otherwise, it will be in the matched posting  amount's  commod-
       ity.

   Re-write rules in a file
       During  the  run  this  tool will execute so called "Automated Transac-
       tions" found in any journal it process.  I.e instead of specifying this
       operations in command line you can put them in a journal file.

              $ rewrite-rules.journal

       Make contents look like this:

              = ^income
                  (liabilities:tax)  *.33

              = expenses:gifts
                  budget:gifts  *-1
                  assets:budget  *1

       Note that '=' (equality symbol) that is used instead of date in  trans-
       actions you usually write.  It indicates the query by which you want to
       match the posting to add new ones.

              $ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal -f rewrite-rules.journal > rewritten-tidy-output.journal

       This is something similar to the commands pipeline:

              $ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33' \
                | hledger rewrite -- -f - expenses:gifts      --add-posting 'budget:gifts  *-1'       \
                                                              --add-posting 'assets:budget  *1'       \
                > rewritten-tidy-output.journal

       It  is  important  to understand that relative order of such entries in
       journal is important.  You can re-use result of previously added  post-
       ings.

   Diff output format
       To  use  this tool for batch modification of your journal files you may
       find useful output in form of unified diff.

              $ hledger rewrite -- --diff -f examples/sample.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'

       Output might look like:

              --- /tmp/examples/sample.journal
              +++ /tmp/examples/sample.journal

   rewrite vs. print --auto
       This command predates print --auto, and currently does  much  the  same
       thing, but with these differences:

       o with  multiple files, rewrite lets rules in any file affect all other
         files.  print --auto uses standard directive  scoping;  rules  affect
         only child files.

       o rewrite's  query  limits which transactions can be rewritten; all are
         printed.  print --auto's query limits which transactions are printed.

       o rewrite applies rules specified on command line or  in  the  journal.
         print --auto applies rules specified in the journal.

       when  you enable --strict mode; or you can run any of them on demand by
       providing them as arguments to the check command.   check  produces  no
       output and a zero exit code if all is well.  Eg:

              hledger check                      # run basic checks
              hledger check -s                   # run basic and strict checks
              hledger check ordereddates payees  # run basic checks and two others

       If  you  are  an Emacs user, you can also configure flycheck-hledger to
       run these checks, providing instant feedback as you edit the journal.

       Here are the checks currently available.  Generally, they are performed
       in the order they are shown here (and only the  first  failure  is  re-
       ported).

   Basic checks
       These  important checks are performed by default, by almost all hledger
       commands:

       o parseable - data files are in a supported format, with no syntax  er-
         rors  and no invalid include directives.  This ensures that all files
         exist and are readable.

       o autobalanced - all transactions are balanced, after automatically in-
         ferring missing amounts and  conversion  rates  and  then  converting
         amounts  to cost.  This ensures that each transaction's entry is well
         formed.

       o assertions - all balance assertions in the journal are passing.  Bal-
         ance assertions are a strong defense against errors; they help  catch
         many  problems.   If  this check gets in your way, you can disable it
         with -I/--ignore-assertions.  Or you can add that to your config file
         to disable it by default (and then use -s/--strict or  hledger  check
         assertions to enable it).

   Strict checks
       These  additional  checks  are  performed  by  all  commands  when  the
       -s/--strict flag  is  used  (strict  mode).   They  provide  extra  er-
       ror-catching  power  to  keep your data clean and correct.  Strict mode
       also always enables the assertions check.

       o balanced - like autobalanced, but all conversions between commodities
         must use explicit cost notation or equity  postings.   This  prevents
         wrong conversions caused by typos.

       o commodities  -  all  commodity  symbols  used must be declared.  This
         guards against mistyping or omitting  commodity  symbols.   Declaring
         commodities  also  sets  their  precision for display and transaction
         balancing.

       o accounts - all account names used must be  declared.   This  prevents
         the use of mis-spelled or outdated account names.

   Other checks
       These  are  not wanted by everyone, but can be run using the check com-
       mand:

       o tags - all tags used must be declared.  This prevents mis-spelled tag
         names.  Note hledger fairly often finds unintended tags in comments.

       o payees - all payees used in transactions must be declared.  This will
         force you to declare any new payee name before using it.  Most people
         will probably find this a bit too strict.

       o ordereddates - within each file,  transactions  must  be  ordered  by
         date.   This  is  a simple and effective error catcher.  It's not in-
         cluded in strict mode, but you can add it by running hledger check -s
         ordereddates.  If enabled, this check is performed before balance as-
         sertions.

       o recentassertions - all accounts with balance assertions must have one
         that's within the 7 days before their latest posting.  This will  en-
         courage adding balance assertions for your active asset/liability ac-
         counts,  which  in  turn  should encourage you to reconcile regularly
         with those real world balances - another strong defense  against  er-
         rors.   hledger  close  --assert can help generate assertion entries.
         Over time the older assertions become somewhat redundant, and you can
         remove them if you like (they don't affect performance much, but they
         add some noise to the journal).

       o uniqueleafnames - no two accounts may have the same last account name
         part (eg the checking in assets:bank:checking).   This  ensures  each
         account can be matched by a unique short name, easier to remember and
         to type.

   Custom checks
       You  can build your own custom checks with add-on command scripts.  See
       also Cookbook > Scripting.  Here are some examples from hledger/bin/:

       o hledger-check-tagfiles - all  tag  values  containing  /  (a  forward
         slash) exist as file paths

       o hledger-check-fancyassertions  -  more complex balance assertions are
         passing

   diff
       Compares a particular account's transactions in two  input  files.   It
       shows any transactions to this account which are in one file but not in
       the other.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       More precisely: for each posting affecting this account in either file,
       this  command looks for a corresponding posting in the other file which
       posts the same amount to the same account (ignoring date,  description,
       etc).

       Since it compares postings, not transactions, this also works when mul-
       tiple bank transactions have been combined into a single journal entry.

       This  command is useful eg if you have downloaded an account's transac-
       tions from your bank (eg as CSV data): when hledger and your bank  dis-
       agree  about  the  account  balance, you can compare the bank data with
       your journal to find out the cause.

       Examples:

              $ hledger diff -f $LEDGER_FILE -f bank.csv assets:bank:giro
              These transactions are in the first file only:

              2014/01/01 Opening Balances
                  assets:bank:giro              EUR ...
                  ...
                  equity:opening balances       EUR -...

              These transactions are in the second file only:

   setup
       Check the status of the hledger installation.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       setup tests your hledger installation and prints  a  list  of  results,
       sometimes  with helpful hints.  This is a good first command to run af-
       ter installing hledger.  Also after upgrading, or when something's  not
       working, or just when you want a reminder of where things are.

       It  makes one network request to detect the latest hledger release ver-
       sion.  It's ok if this fails or times out.  It will use ANSI  color  by
       default,  unless  disabled by NO_COLOR or --color=n.  It does not use a
       pager or a config file.

       It expects that the hledger version you are  running  is  installed  in
       your  PATH.   If  not,  it  will stop until you have done that (to keep
       things simple).

       Example:

              $ hledger setup
              Checking your hledger setup..

   test
       Run built-in unit tests.

              Flags:
              no command-specific flags

       This command runs the unit tests built in to hledger  and  hledger-lib,
       printing  the results on stdout.  If any test fails, the exit code will
       be non-zero.

       This is mainly used by hledger developers, but you can also use  it  to
       sanity-check  the  installed  hledger executable on your platform.  All
       tests are expected to pass - if you ever see a failure,  please  report
       as a bug!

       Any  arguments  before  a  -- argument will be passed to the tasty test
       runner as test-selecting -p patterns, and any arguments after  --  will
       be passed to tasty unchanged.

       Examples:

              $ hledger test               # run all unit tests
              $ hledger test balance       # run tests with "balance" in their name
              $ hledger test -- -h         # show tasty's options

PART 5: COMMON TASKS
       Here  are  some  quick  examples  of  how  to  do some basic tasks with
       hledger.

Getting help
       Here's how to list commands and view options and command docs:

              $ hledger                # show available commands
              $ hledger --help         # show common options
              $ hledger CMD --help     # show CMD's options, common options and CMD's documentation

       You can also view your hledger version's manual in several  formats  by
       using the help command.  Eg:

              $ hledger help           # show the hledger manual with info, man or $PAGER (best available)
              $ hledger help journal   # show the journal topic in the hledger manual
              $ hledger help --help    # find out more about the help command

       To   view   manuals   and   introductory   docs   on   the  web,  visit
       https://hledger.org.   Chat  and  mail  list  support  and   discussion
       archives can be found at https://hledger.org/support.

Constructing command lines
       hledger  has  a  flexible command line interface.  We strive to keep it
       simple and ergonomic, but if you run into one of the  sharp  edges  de-
       scribed in OPTIONS, here are some tips that might help:

       o command-specific  options must go after the command (it's fine to put
         common options there too: hledger CMD OPTS ARGS)

       o running add-on executables directly simplifies command  line  parsing
         (hledger-ui OPTS ARGS)

       o enclose "problematic" args in single quotes

       o if  needed, also add a backslash to hide regular expression metachar-
         acters from the shell

       o to see how a misbehaving command line is being parsed, add --debug=2.

Starting a journal file
       hledger  looks  for  your  accounting   data   in   a   journal   file,
       $HOME/.hledger.journal by default:

              $ hledger stats
              The hledger journal file "/Users/simon/.hledger.journal" was not found.
              Please create it first, eg with "hledger add" or a text editor.
              Or, specify an existing journal file with -f or LEDGER_FILE.

       You  can  override this by setting the LEDGER_FILE environment variable
       (see below).  It's a good practice to keep this  important  file  under
       version  control,  and  to start a new file each year.  So you could do
       something like this:

              $ mkdir ~/finance
              $ cd ~/finance
              $ git init
              Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/simon/finance/.git/
              $ touch 2023.journal
              $ echo "export LEDGER_FILE=$HOME/finance/2023.journal" >> ~/.profile
              $ source ~/.profile
              $ hledger stats
              Main file                : /Users/simon/finance/2023.journal
              Included files           :
              Transactions span        :  to  (0 days)
              Last transaction         : none
              Transactions             : 0 (0.0 per day)
              Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
              Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
              Payees/descriptions      : 0
              Accounts                 : 0 (depth 0)
              Commodities              : 0 ()
              Market prices            : 0 ()

Setting LEDGER_FILE
       How to set LEDGER_FILE permanently depends on your setup:

       On unix and mac, running these commands in the terminal will  work  for
       many people; adapt as needed:

              $ echo 'export LEDGER_FILE=~/finance/2023.journal' >> ~/.profile
              $ source ~/.profile

       When  correctly  configured,  in  a  new  terminal  window  env  | grep
       LEDGER_FILE will show your file, and so will hledger files.

       On mac, this additional step might  be  helpful  for  GUI  applications
       (like  Emacs started from the dock): add an entry to ~/.MacOSX/environ-
       ment.plist like

              {
                "LEDGER_FILE" : "~/finance/2023.journal"
              }

       and then run killall Dock in a terminal  window  (or  restart  the  ma-
       chine).

       On Windows, see https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html, or try
       running  these  commands in a powershell window (let us know if it per-
       sists across a reboot, and if you need to be an Administrator):

              > CD
              > MKDIR finance
              > SETX LEDGER_FILE "C:\Users\USERNAME\finance\2023.journal"

       When correctly configured, in a new  terminal  window  $env:LEDGER_FILE
       will show the file path, and so will hledger files.

Setting opening balances
       Pick  a  starting  date  for which you can look up the balances of some
       real-world assets (bank accounts, wallet..)   and  liabilities  (credit
       cards..).

       To  avoid  a  lot of data entry, you may want to start with just one or
       two accounts, like your checking account or cash wallet; and pick a re-
       cent starting date, like today or the start of the week.  You  can  al-
       ways  come  back later and add more accounts and older transactions, eg
       going back to january 1st.

       Add an opening balances transaction to the journal, declaring the  bal-
       ances on this date.  Here are two ways to do it:

       o The  first way: open the journal in any text editor and save an entry
         like this:

                2023-01-01 * opening balances
                    assets:bank:checking                $1000   = $1000
                    assets:bank:savings                 $2000   = $2000
                    assets:cash                          $100   = $100
                    liabilities:creditcard               $-50   = $-50
                    equity:opening/closing balances

         These are start-of-day balances, ie whatever was in  the  account  at
         the end of the previous day.

         The  *  after  the  date  is  an optional status flag.  Here it means
         "cleared & confirmed".

         The currency symbols are optional, but usually a good idea as  you'll
         be dealing with multiple currencies sooner or later.

         The  = amounts are optional balance assertions, providing extra error
         checking.

       o The second way: run hledger add and follow the prompts  to  record  a
         similar transaction:

                $ hledger add
                Adding transactions to journal file /Users/simon/finance/2023.journal
                Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
                Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
                An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
                An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
                If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to go one step backward.
                To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
                To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control-d or control-c.
                Date [2023-02-07]: 2023-01-01
                Description: * opening balances
                Account 1: assets:bank:checking
                Amount  1: $1000
                Account 2: assets:bank:savings
                Amount  2 [$-1000]: $2000
                Account 3: assets:cash
                Amount  3 [$-3000]: $100
                Account 4: liabilities:creditcard
                Amount  4 [$-3100]: $-50
                Account 5: equity:opening/closing balances
                Amount  5 [$-3050]:
                Account 6 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
                2023-01-01 * opening balances
                    assets:bank:checking                      $1000
                    assets:bank:savings                       $2000
                    assets:cash                                $100
                    liabilities:creditcard                     $-50
                    equity:opening/closing balances          $-3050

                Save this transaction to the journal ? [y]:
                Saved.
                Starting the next transaction (. or ctrl-D/ctrl-C to quit)
                Date [2023-01-01]: .

       If  you're  using  version control, this could be a good time to commit
       the journal.  Eg:

              $ git commit -m 'initial balances' 2023.journal

Recording transactions
       As you spend or receive money, you can record these transactions  using
       one  of  the  methods  above (text editor, hledger add) or by using the
       hledger-iadd or hledger-web add-ons, or by using the import command  to
       convert CSV data downloaded from your bank.

       Here  are  some  simple transactions, see the hledger_journal(5) manual
       and hledger.org for more ideas:

              2023/1/10 * gift received
                assets:cash   $20
                income:gifts

              2023.1.12 * farmers market
                expenses:food    $13
                assets:cash

              2023-01-15 paycheck
                income:salary
                assets:bank:checking    $1000

Reconciling
       Periodically you should reconcile - compare your hledger-reported  bal-
       ances  against  external sources of truth, like bank statements or your
       bank's website - to be sure that your ledger accurately represents  the
       real-world  balances  (and,  that  the real-world institutions have not
       made a mistake!).  This gets easy and fast with (1)  practice  and  (2)
       frequency.   If  you do it daily, it can take 2-10 minutes.  If you let
       it pile up, expect it to take longer as you hunt down errors  and  dis-
       crepancies.

       A typical workflow:

       1. Reconcile  cash.   Count  what's  in your wallet.  Compare with what
          hledger reports (hledger bal cash).  If they are different,  try  to
          remember  the  missing transaction, or look for the error in the al-
          ready-recorded transactions.   A  register  report  can  be  helpful
          (hledger  reg cash).  If you can't find the error, add an adjustment
          transaction.  Eg if you have $105 after the above, and can't explain
          the missing $2, it could be:

                  2023-01-16 * adjust cash
                      assets:cash    $-2 = $105
                      expenses:misc

       2. Reconcile checking.  Log in to your bank's website.  Compare today's
          (cleared) balance with hledger's cleared balance (hledger bal check-
          ing -C).  If they are different, track down the error or record  the
          missing  transaction(s) or add an adjustment transaction, similar to
          the above.  Unlike the cash case, you can usually compare the trans-
          action history and running balance from your bank with the  one  re-
          ported  by hledger reg checking -C.  This will be easier if you gen-
          erally record transaction dates quite similar to your bank's  clear-
          ing dates.

       3. Repeat for other asset/liability accounts.

       Tip:  instead of the register command, use hledger-ui to see a live-up-
       dating register while you edit the journal: hledger-ui --watch --regis-
       ter checking -C

       After reconciling, it could be a  good  time  to  mark  the  reconciled
       transactions'  status  as "cleared and confirmed", if you want to track
       that, by adding the * marker.  Eg in the  paycheck  transaction  above,
       insert * between 2023-01-15 and paycheck

       If  you're using version control, this can be another good time to com-
       mit:

              $ git commit -m 'txns' 2023.journal

Migrating to a new file
       At the end of the year, you may want to continue your journal in a  new
       file, so that old transactions don't slow down or clutter your reports,
       and  to  help ensure the integrity of your accounting history.  See the
       close command.

       If using version control, don't forget to git add the new file.

BUGS
       We   welcome   bug   reports   in    the    hledger    issue    tracker
       (https://bugs.hledger.org),  or  on  the  hledger  chat  or  mail  list
       (https://hledger.org/support).

       Some known issues and limitations:

       The need to precede add-on command options with --  when  invoked  from
       hledger is awkward.  (See Command options, Constructing command lines.)

       A  system  locale  with  a suitable text encoding must be configured to
       work with non-ascii data.  (See Text encoding, Troubleshooting.)

       On Microsoft Windows, depending whether you are running in a CMD window
       or a Cygwin/MSYS/Mintty window and how you installed hledger, non-ascii
       characters and colours may not be supported, and the tab key may not be
       supported by hledger add.  (Running in  a  WSL  window  should  resolve
       these.)

       When processing large data files, hledger uses more memory than Ledger.

   Troubleshooting
       Here  are  some common issues you might encounter when you run hledger,
       and how to resolve them (and remember also you can  usually  get  quick
       Support):

       PATH issues: I get an error like "No command 'hledger' found"
       Depending how you installed hledger, the executables may not be in your
       shell's  PATH.   Eg  on  unix systems, stack installs hledger in ~/.lo-
       cal/bin and cabal installs it in ~/.cabal/bin.  You may need to add one
       of these directories to your shell's PATH, and/or open a  new  terminal
       window.

       LEDGER_FILE  issues:  I configured LEDGER_FILE but hledger is not using
       it
       o LEDGER_FILE should be a real environment variable, not just  a  shell
         variable.  Eg on unix, the command env | grep LEDGER_FILE should show
         it.    You   may   need   to   use   export  (see  https://stackover-
         flow.com/a/7411509).  On Windows, $env:LEDGER_FILE should show it.

       o You may need to force your shell to see  the  new  configuration.   A
         simple way is to close your terminal window and open a new one.

       Text decoding issues: I get errors like "Illegal byte sequence" or "In-
       valid  or incomplete multibyte or wide character" or "commitAndRelease-
       Buffer: invalid argument (invalid character)"
       hledger usually needs its input to be decodable  with  the  system  lo-
       cale's text encoding.  See Text encoding and Install: Text encoding.

       COMPATIBILITY ISSUES: hledger gives an error with my Ledger file
       Not  all  of  Ledger's journal file syntax or feature set is supported.
       See hledger and Ledger for full details.
