- hledger 1.40, september
- hledger 1.34, june
- hledger 1.33, april

## 2023

**Targets:**
- hledger 1.32, december
- hledger 1.31, september

**Goals:**
  - CSV extensibility: workflows to obtain, use, develop, share, contribute ready-to-use CSV rules
  - Scripts extensibility: workflows to obtain, use, develop, share, contribute ready-to-use scripts
  - Interop: clear ledger & beancount import/export how-tos documenting issues & workarounds
  - Better installer: more robust, binary-installing
  - Bar charts: simple built in bar charts
  - Investment: clear updated how-to documenting available tools & best practices for common needs (price fetching, lot reducing, lot reporting, cost reporting, gains reporting)

**Priorities:**
- newcomer/learner experience: docs, installers, demos
- customiser/contributor experience: easy csv rules install/contrib, scripts install/contrib
- maintainer experience: reduce tech/doc/process/issue debt, increase velocity
- marketing/community: news updates, mastodon presence
- interop: solve Ledger/Beancount reading/writing/conversion
- features: charts, investment

**Mission:**
1. Make plain text accounting more usable and useful for all
