* 'NoSpan' means a single unmerged cell.

* 'Covered' is a cell if it is part of a horizontally or vertically merged cell.
  We maintain these cells although they are ignored in HTML output.
  In contrast to that, FODS can store covered cells
  and allows to access the hidden cell content via formulas.
  CSV does not support merged cells
  and thus simply writes the content of covered cells.
  Maintaining 'Covered' cells also simplifies transposing.

* @'SpanHorizontal' n@ denotes the first cell in a row
  that is part of a merged cell.
  The merged cell contains @n@ atomic cells, including the first one.
  That is @SpanHorizontal 1@ is actually like @NoSpan@.
  The content of this cell is shown as content of the merged cell.

* @'SpanVertical' n@ starts a vertically merged cell.

The writer functions expect consistent data,
that is, 'Covered' cells must actually be part of a merged cell
and merged cells must only cover 'Covered' cells.
