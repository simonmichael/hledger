Timedot - hledger's human-friendly time logging format

   Timedot is a plain text format for logging dated, categorised
quantities (of time, usually), supported by hledger.  It is convenient
for approximate and retroactive time logging, eg when the real-time
clock-in/out required with a timeclock file is too precise or too
interruptive.  It can be formatted like a bar chart, making clear at a
glance where time was spent.

   Though called "timedot", this format is read by hledger as
commodityless quantities, so it could be used to represent dated
quantities other than time.  In the docs below we'll assume it's time.

   A timedot file contains a series of day entries.  A day entry begins
with a non-indented hledger-style simple date (Y-M-D, Y/M/D, Y.M.D..)
Any additional text on the same line is used as a transaction
description for this day.

   This is followed by optionally-indented timelog items for that day,
one per line.  Each timelog item is a note, usually a
hledger:style:account:name representing a time category, followed by two
or more spaces, and a quantity.  Each timelog item generates a hledger
transaction.

   Quantities can be written as:

   * dots: a sequence of dots (.)  representing quarter hours.  Spaces
     may optionally be used for grouping.  Eg: ....  ..

   * an integral or decimal number, representing hours.  Eg: 1.5

   * an integral or decimal number immediately followed by a unit symbol
     's', 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w', 'mo', or 'y', representing seconds,
     minutes, hours, days weeks, months or years respectively.  Eg: 90m.
     The following equivalencies are assumed, currently: 1m = 60s, 1h =
     60m, 1d = 24h, 1w = 7d, 1mo = 30d, 1y=365d.

   There is some flexibility allowing notes and todo lists to be kept
right in the time log, if needed:

   * Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored.

   * Lines not ending with a double-space and quantity are parsed as
     items taking no time, which will not appear in balance reports by
     default.  (Add -E to see them.)

   * Org mode headlines (lines beginning with one or more '*' followed
     by a space) can be used as date lines or timelog items (the stars
     are ignored).  Also all org headlines before the first date line
     are ignored.  This means org users can manage their timelog as an
     org outline (eg using org-mode/orgstruct-mode in Emacs), for
     organisation, faster navigation, controlling visibility etc.

   Examples:

# on this day, 6h was spent on client work, 1.5h on haskell FOSS work, etc.
2016/2/1

   I prefer to use period for separating account components.  We can
make this work with an account alias:

2016/2/4
fos.hledger.timedot  4
fos.ledger           ..

$ hledger -f t.timedot --alias /\\./=: bal date:2016/2/4
                4.50  fos
                4.00    hledger:timedot
                0.50    ledger
