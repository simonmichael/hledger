type Balance = MixedAmount  -- ^ An ending balance as of some date.
type Total   = MixedAmount  -- ^ The sum of 'Change's in a report or a report row. Does not make sense for 'Balance's.
type Average = MixedAmount  -- ^ The average of 'Change's or 'Balance's in a report or report row.

-- | A periodic report is a generic tabular report, where each row corresponds
-- to some label (usually an account name) and each column to a date period.
-- The column periods are usually consecutive subperiods formed by splitting
-- the overall report period by some report interval (daily, weekly, etc.).
-- It has:
--
-- 1. a list of each column's period (date span)
--
-- 2. a list of rows, each containing:
--
--   * an account label
--
--   * the account's depth
--
--   * A list of amounts, one for each column. Depending on the value type,
--     these can represent balance changes, ending balances, budget
--     performance, etc. (for example, see 'BalanceType' and
--     "Hledger.Cli.Commands.Balance").
--
--   * the total of the row's amounts for a periodic report,
--     or zero for cumulative/historical reports (since summing
--     end balances generally doesn't make sense).
--
--   * the average of the row's amounts
--
-- 3. the column totals, and the overall grand total (or zero for
-- cumulative/historical reports) and grand average.
